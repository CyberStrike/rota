Arin thrust his arm forward, palm up, and released a telekinetic blast toward Ryan's tumbling form. The Alterran flipped backwards onto his hands, his back bending at an impossible angle for a Human, and whipped his legs up over his head and into Bret's chest, knocking him backward as Arin's invisible blow sent him half tumbling to the side.

Ryan had felt the energy building in Arin and had produced a negation field around himself in time to absorb part of the blow, but not all of it. He fell onto his right knee and tumbled over laterally until he landed on his chest, momentarily knocking the wind out of him.

Even without breath, he glanced at Arin and pulled his feet out from under him. His cloned brother backbent and caught himself with his hands on the ground then whip kicked his feet up over him and back around to the ground where he took a guard stance, forearms out in front of him.

Ryan sucked in a quick breath and stabilized himself. He rolled up on his right shoulder and pushed himself up onto his feet one handed. He twirled about, arms spread, just in time to hit Bret squarely in the chest as his other brother tried to catch him off guard with his own telekinetic blast.

As Bret flinched backwards from the impact, Ryan bent down, gathered his knees beneath him, then launched upward in a massive jump…

He caught the railing of the catwalk above them in the Alterran-only training chamber and easily wicked himself up and over the edge where he looked back down on his twins as they came together, shoulder to shoulder beneath him, and telekinetically picked up and hurled several heavy, but soft cubes scattered around the chamber at him.

Ryan half extended his hand and stopped them midway… his energy-based skills were far beyond those of his clones and the rest of the Alterra, but even with his advantage he was having a hard time keeping his two opponents at bay.

Arin was the clone dedicated to studying and improving his hand to hand combat, while Bret had self-assigned himself to developing superior personal armor and weapons… the likes of which he now used on Ryan.

The original Stevenson dropped to a knee on the catwalk as he was caught by a widespread stun pulse from Bret's wrist blaster. The disabling energy fought to interrupt and overwhelm the impulses of his nervous system in a tug of war with Ryan's own internal purging wave. His body, ever more attuned to the flow of energy with each passing day, absorbed and flushed the stun blast in a cascade of static electricity redirected into the metal grating of the catwalk beneath him.

In the four seconds the process took, Arin had leapt up onto the catwalk and kicked into the side of Ryan's chest. He fell onto his side and suddenly found Arin on top of him, wresting for leverage.

A moment later Bret joined him and they pressed their elder brother to the ground… pinned. A second stun blast made sure he'd stay put.

Arin stood up and smiled above Ryan's prone form. "Five/seven now."

"Two beats one any day," Bret said, fist bumping Arin.

"Ah," Ryan moaned, purging the second stunblast and sitting up beneath their proud gazes. They were catching up.

"Round 13," Ryan said, focusing hard. He lifted both of the clones off their feet and threw them over the edge of the catwalk… where they nimbly regained their balance midair and landed on their feet.

"What are you doing here?" McKay asked Zelenka as he slipped into the seat in front of Rodney.

"The same reason you are, I imagine," the other scientist replied pithily. "Mereiov is instructing us in the basics of hyperspace travel."

"Even Lanteans," McKay said, crossing his arms and leaning back in his 'desk.'

Zelenka frowned. "What is that supposed to mean?"

"Don't you just download everything you need," McKay said, pointing his index finger at his temple.

"Actually no," Zelenka corrected. "We have to earn those first."

"Really… and what do you have to do for that?"

"Prove a basic understanding of the underlying principles. Without them, the knowledge downloads would only allow us to reciprocate the data."

"I thought that was the whole point," McKay argued.

"Actually no… at least not how it was explained by Janus. In order to be able to one day go beyond the Ancient knowledge, we must first understand it. Apparently you can't download comprehension."

"But isn't that exactly what our beloved master Ancient had done to him?"

Zelenka shrugged. "Perhaps… but he isn't technically a scientist, just knowledgeable. Janus heads our department, and he's said that that he also had to master the basics in order to be able to fully process the knowledge downloads."

"Guess your transformation wasn't that useful after all," McKay grumbled.

"You'd be surprised," Zelenka said evenly. "My mental processing power has increased greatly… and I don't require as much sleep, meaning I can work longer hours and the all-nighters aren't as debilitating," he said as three more individuals entered the room. They were also candidate scientists, two from the Traveler fleet and one from the Genii that had arrived less than a month ago when Sheppard arranged for their membership in what he jokingly referred to as their 'Federation.'

"I always wondered what it'd be like to go back to kindergarten," McKay half whispered as the others found seats in the enlarged, semi-circular briefing room.

"I hope you don't plan to be rude when Mereiov arrives."

"Or what?" McKay scoffed.

Zelenka frowned. "If you're not here to learn… "

"Oh, I'm here to learn," McKay clarified. "It's either this or sit in my quarters twiddling my thumbs. Weir won't let me go back to working on the city until I pass baby boot camp."

"You know, the Alterra are far more knowledgeable about Atlantis than we are," Zelenka whispered as more candidates arrived.

Rodney leaned forward. "We took care of this city for six years on our own. Don't you think that should count for something?"

"You think it hasn't?" Zelenka asked, somewhat surprised.

"If it did, we wouldn't be stuck back in school."

"Well, I for one look forward to the studies. We'll probably learn more in the next three hours than Earth could have in 3000 years without outside help."

"Thank you, Mr. Positive," McKay snided as Mereiov walked into the room and up onto the central podium that had been adjusted for his diminished height. He activated a holographic map of hyperspace around 'Dune.'

"These sensor readings," the Asgard began, "are being taken from the vicinity around Atlantis and will be updated continuously as the city's sensors sweep the system. This is the dimension known as Nifleheym by the Ancients, but most species refer to it as 'hyperspace' due to the rapid transit it allows due to an absence of matter of any kind."

"Tell me something I don't know," McKay whispered behind Zelenka where the Asgard couldn't see his lips.

"Interstellar travel through hyperspace," Mereiov continued ,oblivious, "is achieved through a variety of means, all of which create an interference field around the matter of the craft in question, allowing it to transition into the alternate dimension and remain there for an indefinite amount of time. However, if this field is deactivated, or dissipates below sustainable levels, the matter is automatically reverted back into the dimension from whence it came. This aspect of hyperspace allows for the inertia misalignment achieved during the initial transition between dimensions to be reversed without additional power output."

The Genii raised a hand.

"Yes… " Mereiov asked monotone.

"My knowledge of hyperspace is still theoretical, and basic at best, but are you saying that whatever speed a ship achieves in hyperspace is instantaneously negated when it returns to our dimension?"

"Provisionally, yes," Mereiov answered. "If such speed was attained through the transition between realms, it will be reversed upon any exit from hyperspace. If the acceleration was achieved once inside hyperspace, that inertia will not be negated and it will carry over into realspace… which the Ancients refer to as Midgar."

"Whoa… whoa… wait a minute," McKay interrupted, snapping his fingers to get the little alien's attention. "You can't accelerate inside hyperspace. All the speed comes from the dimensional cheat."

"That may be true of some hyperdrive engine designs, but it is not an absolute rule," Mereiov explained patiently. "Most primitive technology uses thrust-based engines to achieve acceleration and maneuvering, which cannot pass beyond the interference field without reverting to realspace. When such matter connects with the field, it destabilizes it proportional to the mass and velocity of the thrust, resulting in a collapse that automatically takes the ship out of hyperspace. This makes any thrust-based engines nearly inoperable within hyperspace… however, other non-matter based engines can be used without jeopardizing the integrity of the field."

"Interesting," McKay mused. "What level of matter interference are we talking about?"

"A single thruster burst from your Earth designed ships would be sufficient to jeopardize the weaker fields produced by your hyperdrive technology."

"Our technology? We got it from you," he pointed out.

"Yes, but it had to be downgraded in order to accommodate your lack of necessary support systems, composite materials, and power generation."

McKay's eyes widened. "Are you saying you gave us junk hyperdrive technology?!"

"I've reviewed the designs you were given," Mereiov said, refusing to be angered by McKay's thinly veiled insults. "They are as advanced as were possible given the construction of your ships. The hyperdrives on our vessels are based on similar principles, but the application is far superior due to the technology of our support systems."

"Isn't the hyperdrive technology independent from other systems?" the outspoken Genii inquired.

"What he said," McKay added.

"Partially," the Asgard stated, "but power generation is independent from the hyperdrive, as are the navigation and computer systems. A standard Asgard hyperdrive requires more power than naquada generators can provide, better sensors for accurate navigation at higher speeds, and more advanced processing capability in order to operate the device properly."

"So the starship is an integrated technology," the Genii said reflectively, "not just a frame with separate components attached."

"Correct," Mereiov said with just a hint of satisfaction.

"Show off," McKay mumbled. "So… how fast are your ships anyway?"

"Faster than Earth's… slower than the Ancients'."

"Gee, thanks," McKay mocked. "Care to narrow it down a bit more."

"No."

"No?" McKay half laughed. "What, are you afraid we'll steal your secrets?"

"I doubt you have the mental capacity to profit from any such theft."

Zelenka stifled a laugh, but McKay caught it anyway.

"Asgard humor, no doubt," he said, glaring at the back of Zelenka's head.

"There are many hyperspace applications," Mereiov continued, ignoring the jest. "We will study two today. The basics of the most primitive hyperdrive engine… and the mechanics of the stargates."

McKay perked up at that. "Really?"

Zelenka half turned around. "Rodney, please shut up."

"How about you make me, raggedy Andy."

"Who?"

"Never mind."

"Perhaps you would like to explain the function of the stargates?" Mereiov offered.

"What's the point," McKay said, sighing. "You're just going to disagree with whatever I say anyway."

"Probably," the Asgard confirmed.

McKay threw him an annoyed glance.

"Alright then...Stargates 101. You have an entry gate and an exit gate. They establish a wormhole through subspace between the two that transmits a deconstructed matter stream."

"Incorrect," Mereiov noted.

"How?" McKay asked. He'd tried to simplify it beyond disagreement.

"What you refer to as 'subspace' is a mathematical fiction. The stargates operate as a portal into hyperspace."

Rodney's jaw dropped. "How?"

"Makes sense, actually," Zelenka finally spoke. "That's why the Attero device affected the stargates."

"Indeed," Mereiov confirmed.

"What's the Attero device?" one of the Travelers asked. "That wasn't in our notes."

Zelenka glanced at Mereiov then turned toward the woman to explain. "The Attero device was the Lanteans' attempt to defeat the Wraith by tampering with their hyperdrives across the galaxy simultaneously. The device produced a disturbance in hyperspace that affected only their type of hyperdrives, causing the destruction of their ships whenever they attempted to use them. Unfortunately, the technology also disrupted the function of the stargates, causing them to overload when used."

The Traveler's eyes went wide with comprehension. "That's what destroyed our colony?"

"Unfortunately yes," Zelenka confirmed.

"Who used it?" she demanded.

"Our little grey buddies," McKay said, smiling.

"You did!" the Traveler demanded.

"It was not me," the Asgard said unabashedly. "But we must all pay the debt of those who did, no matter how unenviable the task," Mereiov said, looking directly at McKay.

"How do the stargates attain the nearly instantaneous transit times across galaxies," Zelenka asked, both interested in the topic and in changing the subject, "when a ship cannot?"

"The stargates create a super-accelerating conduit," Mereiov was glad to explain, "that has an internal, oscillating structure that drags an energized matter packet through an isolated region of hyperspace… observe," he said, using remote controls on his dais to activate Atlantis's stargate.

The holographic image of hyperspace was streaked by a long thin line emanating from the point where Atlantis rested and off the map to the destination.

"The conduit is not a fixed route," Mereiov explained. "Fluctuations within hyperspace will cause the route to meander, but the polarity of the energy matrix keeps both ends secured to the pair of stargates. Transit time will vary slightly, dependent on the length of the conduit during these fluctuations."

"Interesting," the Genii muttered.

"Hold on a minute," McKay interrupted again. "If it's a polarized conduit, and not a traditional wormhole, how can we receive EM against the flow?"

"The oscillating nature requires a reverse flow around the perimeter of the conduit in order to keep the entire matrix self-contained. Certain types of energy can be carried along this backflow, but matter cannot."

"Like how a waterslide recirculates the water uphill through the plumbing," Zelenka said, thinking aloud, "but the person can only go downhill."

Mereiov's eyelids rose. "Waterslide?"

"I'm sorry," Zelenka said, shaking his head. "It's a type of amusement ride on Earth. A small amount of water is run downhill through a half tube to provide lubrication for a person to slide down."

"Sounds fun," the Traveler woman said.

"So I've heard," Zelenka said.

"Wait a minute," McKay interrupted. "You've never gone down a waterslide?"

"No," he admitted.

McKay shook his head. "Why am I not surprised."

"Your analogy is sound," Mereiov approved, "if the water is recirculated."

"It is," Zelenka confirmed.

"How is your initial speed obtained?"

Zelenka shrugged. "The friction of the moving water, I suppose."

"That and you push off with your hands," McKay added.

"Then in this analogy," Mereiov continued to explain, "the stargates provide the initial 'push' as you suggest. The flow of the conduit completes the acceleration, as well as insuring that the object is insulated against disruptive factors within hyperspace. The receiving stargate slows the object to a stop where the energy stasis is reversed."

"What is this energy stasis?" the Genii asked.

"Any object passing through the stargate has to be capsulated in an energy stasis field in order to be transported through hyperspace, much like a ship must be engulfed in a similar interference field to allow its passage."

"I thought the traveler was disassembled at the molecular level?" Zelenka asked, confused.

"Such deconstruction would be fatal," Mereiov noted.

"Then how do your transport beams work?" McKay argued.

"They also engulf the target in an energy stasis… but they do not break the molecular bonds."

"Then our entire understanding of stargate technology is flawed," Zelenka announced, then caught himself. "Earth's I mean."

"Mine too, apparently," McKay said, his sarcasm momentarily gone. His scientific curiosity had just exceeded his ego. "Am I safe in assuming that the acceleration and deceleration of the stargates is also due to an inertial cheat."

"You are," Mereiov confirmed.

"What about the rest of the inertia?"

"The nature of the stasis field allows for extreme deceleration through energy-related means. The matter remains unaffected until the stargate removes the stasis."

"Interesting… "McKay mused. "I assume this stasis acts like some sort of inertial dampening field?"

Mereiov made a sound similar to a meek grunt. "That is a crude metaphor, but it will suffice for the moment."

McKay thought quietly for a moment, but the Genii had a question. "What is it that we're seeing on the other side of the event horizon? I mean, before we're completely inside."

"It is an artificial pocket of a hybrid dimension… part realspace, part hyperspace. This is where the object is applied with a stasis field, and likewise where that field is removed prior to exiting the target event horizon."

"There was a mishap on Earth," McKay explained, "where a person traveling through the stargate was stuck inside when the entry stargate was destroyed during transit. If the matter of the traveler isn't deconstructed, where was he held?"

"Was there something anomalous with the receiving stargate?" Mereiov asked.

"Not that I recall," McKay said, his tone civil. "The only extraneous factor was on the other end."

"The dialing device prevents such mishaps from occurring," Mereiov explained. "The stargates have many safety protocols imbedded within them. If those fail, backup protocols within the dialing device assess the nature of the problem and correct it. It is highly unlikely that such an error would bypass both layers of safeguards."

McKay tilted his head to the side. "Well, Earth doesn't use a DHD… dialing device. We built a custom one when the stargate was discovered without one."

"I see," Mereiov said, unimpressed. "Was this person recovered?"

"Yes… we had to borrow another dialing device and get some intelligence from a captive Goa'uld, but we managed to save him."

"In that case, the person in question was most likely held in stasis within the hybrid dimension. If the event horizon is not activated, then the stasis will not be repealed."

"Because it would kill the person," McKay said, beginning to make sense of things. "How come we don't explode from decompression on the other side?"

"The hybrid dimension is configured in such a way to mimic the conditions of the environment affecting the event horizon. This includes pressure and temperature, but not gravity."

"I was wondering about that too," McKay said, nodding. "Whenever I go through the stargate I feel constrained for a split second. I expect my foot to drop off into nowhere but it never does… I also can't exhale."

"Such is necessary to register your entry velocity and trajectory. Gravity on the other side of the event horizon would skew this, as would a solid surface beneath your feet. A long object entering the event horizon from an angle must be allowed to fully enter the dimensional pocket before encapsulation. This means it must be allowed to extend beyond the ring. For this purpose, the pocket dimension is designed to be enlarged as necessary to accommodate any and all objects that will fit through the ring."

"What about a puddle jumper?" McKay asked, dominating the class, but too interested to notice or care. "Why do the pilots undergo stasis before the craft does?"

"They are not connected to the craft, therefore as soon as their bodies fully pass through the event horizon they undergo stasis. If they did not, they could be asphyxiated before the entire craft entered if it was moving very slowly."

"True, true," McKay noted. "Please continue."

Sitting in front of McKay where he couldn't see, Zelenka smiled at his friend's sudden change of demeanor.

---

On Dakara the stargate activated its end of the conduit through hyperspace and deposited two travelers from Earth safely onto the desert world. Moments afterward a transport beam plucked the men off the surface and set them down inside the bridge of one of the Jaffa's new H'tels.

"Bra'tac… " one of the new arrivals greeted the System Lord seated in his command chair.

The Alterra nodded his respect. "O'Neill."

"We're good to go," the General said positively. "There'll be hell to pay back on Earth, but we've got to nip this in the bud while we still can."

"Indeed," Bra'tac agreed, turning towards his helmsman. "Set course for Osser."

The Jaffa did as bidden and opened a hyperspace window. The scattering of air molecules high above Dakara's atmosphere impacted the window and were repelled, but the H'tel with its interference field fully deployed around it passed through into a narrow hybrid dimension. There the full power of the ship's engines were applied and created the dimensional 'cheat' where the ship entered into hyperspace with an inertial momentum far greater than it had in realspace.

With the power generation capabilities of the Jaffa's new technology, that 'cheat' was in excess of any other ship within the galaxy… not to mention greater than that the Asgard and the Furlings were capable of generating. Due to such extreme engine power, the H'tel would arrive at the Chinese-held world, a quarter of the way across the galaxy, within the hour.

"Proximity warning," Xiang said calmly from the control center on Osser.

"What have we got?" Zi, his commanding officer, asked.

"No comm chatter, but we are picking up IFF," Xiang said, frowning. "It's not an Earth ship."

"Translate into Goa'uld," Zi ordered stiffly.

Xiang brought up the computer's translation protocols and quickly got a match for the matrix the IFF was operating on. The blank receiver screen flashed the translated identification tag:

_Jaffa H'tel 002: in the service of Lord Bra'tac, First of the System Lords._

Zi's eyes went wide. "What's their heading?"

Xiang panickly brought up a crude, 3D radar tracking prompt. He turned and looked up at his superior, his face white. "They're coming into the atmosphere and they're heading directly for us!"

"Get the pilots to their fighters!" Zi yelled so the entire control staff could hear him clearly. "Begin evacuation of key personnel. Purge all databases. Have the cargo ships cloak immediately then move to the pickup points. We can't take the chance of them being picked off on the ground. Dial an uninhabited world and begin evacuation of secondary personnel. How long do we have?"

"Six minutes," Xiang said firmly.

"Purge status?" Zi demanded as the control staff hurriedly worked to carry out his orders.

"Twenty seven percent," another staffer yelled over the din.

"Stay with it until completion, then get to the gate," Zi ordered as he and the other control staff began finishing their tasks and running out of the building, grabbing whatever transportation they could or just making a run on foot towards the stargate set less than a kilometer outside the northern edge of their city.

---

As the Chinese overseers on Osser scrambled to evacuate either by cargo ship or stargate, the H'tel slowly broke through the thick cloud layer above the dozens of settlements and hovered in place, inciting additional terror in the fleeing Tauri.

A pair of small missiles lanced out from a low flying 302 and struck the Jaffa mothership's shields ineffectively. A short burst of stuttered energy blasts followed from the fighter before it arced up and into the clouds, turning away from the massive vessel.

Two more fighters made a run from the south with similar results. By the time all six of the Chinese 302s got into the air and were making their runs against the H'tel the first of the evacuees had reached the stargate… save for the guards who had gone through immediately.

With the gnat-like 302s spinning around the mothership expending their ordinance, the H'tel suddenly dropped its shields… followed by a transport beam stretching out and impacting one of the circling 302s. As soon as the beam retracted the Tauri fighter fell out of control towards the city but it never made it to ground. A short burst of weapons fire from the H'tel destroyed it midair, leaving only bits and pieces to damage the buildings and streets below.

Presented with an opportunity, the 302s launched all of their remaining missiles into the shieldless mothership as more transport beams continued to pluck the pilots from their ships. Five missiles and many small energy blasts hit the armored hull of the H'tel, chipping away at the red and black protective layer, but failing to penetrate it. Within twenty seconds all of the 302s had been deprived of their controllers and destroyed.

The next transport beam began plucking up the Tauri running and driving towards the stargate. One small motorized cart was within 20 meters of the gate when its passengers disappeared, but being so close to its destination it continued forward, slowing as it went, but still managed to make it through the event horizon. It was the last thing, living or otherwise, to do so.

Suddenly over two dozen Jaffa fighters, tiny in size and colored red/gold, launched from the mothership and arced up into the clouds. Using telemetry relayed from the H'tel, they began chasing the cloaked cargo ships as they attempted to flee the planet. They had a few thousand kilometers to do so before the primitive cloaking devices would be sufficient to hide the ships from the powerful Ancient sensors aboard the H'tel.

The small, angular fighters chased after the slower cargo ships with a fury, knowing that they weren't going to catch them all in time, but the pilots wanted to get as many as they could in order to impress Bra'tac and perhaps earn their new symbiots faster than expected. When the Lok'na'te came within range of the Tauri vessels they attacked with their tiny disruption pulses, each little more than a tiny bolt of orange energy that would interfere with the operations of the ships, but do very little hull damage.

Low powered as the weapons were, Bra'tac had made a point to include them in the fighter design. If the Jaffa were to be tasked with the protection and peace keeping of Avalona, then they were likely to encounter more situations where a vessel needed to be taken intact rather than outright destroyed.

Disabling the weapon and engine systems of a craft without critically damaging it was no small feat with conventional weapons, but the disruptor made it easy for even a novice pilot to accomplish the same task. Any impact on the hull would spread out and deaden the ship's systems.

Several hits were necessary to fully disable the cargo ships, but one was all it took to temporarily knock out their cloaking devices. As such, all the Jaffa needed to do was 'tag' each ship once and that would effectively extend their range of pursuit.

Even with their cloaks down, a few more of the cargo ships managed to make the jump to hyperspace. At that point the Lok'na'te could no longer pursue, devoid of any interstellar engines of their own, but they had managed to disable four of the fourteen craft and circled them like sharks in orbit, insuring they would not repower their systems and escape before the H'tel returned to pick them up.

Back on the ground the transport beams canvassed the streets closest to the stargate, picking up any and all personnel moving about, but they left those remaining within the buildings alone for the time being. After a few minutes the stargate shut down and the H'tel sent a signal offworld. Less than a minute later an incoming wormhole activated and a large contingent of Jaffa stepped through, weapons ready, along with seven Tok'ra. Behind them came more Jaffa carrying cargo crates which the Tok'ra began taking components out of in a small clearing less than 50 meters from the stargate.

Within a few minutes the Tok'ra had the first of their force shield containment wards set up and the H'tel beamed three people back down inside the fence-like perimeter.

"Do not be afraid," Delek said to the frightened villagers from the opposite side of the translucent containment field. "We are here to help you."

---

"Yes… .yes… .yes… .yes… .no," O'Neill said, pointing to the line of people being processed onboard the mothership. The woman he was pointing at, next in line, was escorted off to the left into another room by one of the Jaffa where she would be beamed back down to the surface.

"Yes… .yes… .yes," O'Neill continued, picking out the Chinese from the villagers. The illicit Tauri were escorted off to the right into several prepared holding cells in addition to the ones that came standard with the ship.

"Yep… .uhuh… .you betcha… .nope," he said, catching another of the villagers and sending him out of line as Jack quickly got tired with repetitive 'yeses.'

"Oh yeah… .bingo… .absolutely… .totally… .definitely… .undeniably… .positively," he went on until he saw a person he couldn't quite place. "Hold up fellas!"

O'Neill turned around. "Mitchell?"

"On it," the Colonel said, walking up to the questionable person next in line. "What's your name?" he asked in Chinese.

The young man looked at him blankly, not saying anything.

"Do you understand me, son?" Mitchell tried again.

The man nodded.

"What's your name?" Mitchell repeated.

"Xang," he said meekly.

"Relax Xang," Mitchell said, exchanging a glance with O'Neill, "you'll be seeing home within the day."

O'Neill pointed to the right and the Jaffa escorted the man off to the holding cells. "Next… "

---

Seven hours later O'Neill, Mitchell, and Bra'tac beamed down to the impromptu Tok'ra encampment where they were holding the 7,539 natives as the Jaffa/Tok'ra taskforce continued to bring more equipment through the nearby stargate.

"That went well," Mitchell said as Delek walked over to meet the trio.

"Yes, very nice," O'Neill said, congratulating Bra'tac.

The System Lord nodded. "I too am glad we were able to avoid bloodshed. It will be a sad day indeed if the Jaffa and Tauri were ever to meet on the field of battle. Thank your President for sanctioning this mission. He has shown wisdom this day."

"Well, I wouldn't go that far," O'Neill cautioned, "but we had to do something about the Chinese."

"Your involvement just made the whole mess a lot cleaner," Mitchell added.

"Had your President not approved of this," Bra'tac warned, "we would have been forced to act on our own eventually. I hope that you will be able to secure this rogue faction from your world?"

"That's the plan," O'Neill said sarcastically, "but you know what they say of the best laid plans."

"Indeed," Bra'tac said, nodding as Delek finally caught up to them.

"I assume you've cleared all of the settlements?" the Tok'ra asked brusquely.

"We have," Bra'tac confirmed. "Have you located the Tauri command center?"

"Yes, but it is too small and primitive for our needs. I've requested additional supplies from our homeworld, including several prefabricated structures. Once those are set up we will begin making what use we can of the indigenous buildings. It will be difficult, given that the infrastructure on this planet was designed to supplement your world as opposed to making Osser self-sufficient, but we will make sure this civilization doesn't spiral out of control in the Tauri's absence."

O'Neill sensed the subtle rebuke there, but in truth he agreed with the Tok'ra… for once.

"Thanks for cleaning up our mess," he offered candidly.

"I assume changes will be made on Earth to prevent this sort of thing from happening again?"

"We're working on it," O'Neill said, not satisfied with his own answer.

"I imagine," Bra'tac offered, "that such change will come at a cost to your world?"

"If you mean will we start fighting each other militarily… probably not. On Earth we usually use other means. Right now China has managed to tick off just about everyone and isolate itself, but if they really want to dig their heels in there will be trouble."

Bra'tac nodded. He'd seen many such power struggles between the Goa'uld over his century of service to Apophis. "Let us hope they will see reason and do not attempt this again."

"We'll be on the watch now," Mitchell assured him. "They set all this up in secret… that's an advantage they don't have anymore."

"There is still the matter of the four other worlds they have taken," Delek reminded them.

O'Neill and Bra'tac exchanged glances. "We hope they will voluntarily cede those worlds when we return to Earth and they hear from their own people what has transpired on this day," Bra'tac said.

Delek looked at the two Tauri. "Will that happen?"

O'Neill shrugged. "If not we'll just use the mothership approach again. They don't have anything bigger than a cargo ship to fight back with."

"And," Mitchell added, "once their ego gets bruised by this they may want to avoid it happening four more times."

"Let us hope so," Bra'tac echoed. "Delek, have you any further need of the H'tel?"

The Tok'ra considered for a moment. "I would recommend a full sensor sweep of the planet to insure all of the Tauri are actually gone, but if that is the case I see no further need for its presence."

Bra'tac nodded. "We will depart for Earth then."

"Good luck," Delek offered to O'Neill, out of character.

"Thanks," Jack said as Bra'tac conversed with several of his Jaffa that he was leaving on the planet to assist the Tok'ra. Delek left the group to continue the restructuring of Osser that would allow the natives to be gradually released from their temporary confinement.

Mitchell stepped closer to O'Neill and whispered over his shoulder.

"Did that stiff-assed Tok'ra just wish us luck?"

"I know," Jack said, equally surprised. "Then again, he didn't specify what kind."

Mitchell snickered. "No sir, I suppose he didn't."

"Ten bucks says the next thing that comes out of his mouth is a complaint," O'Neill offered lightly.

"I'd say that's a pretty safe bet," Mitchell confirmed.

"No takers?"

Cam tilted his neck innocently. "I may still be the new guy, but I wasn't born yesterday."

"Damn," Jack half whispered in defeat as Bra'tac returned.

"The grain you spoke of is indeed Kassa," he relayed to them.

"Totally saw that one coming," Cam said.

O'Neill raised an eyebrow. "Don't suppose they left any records of where they were sending it?"

Bra'tac shook his head. "Their data systems were deleted prior to our arrival. We are currently attempting to access the navigational logs on two of the cargo ships. They may offer some insight into the matter."

"How long will that take?" O'Neill asked.

"A matter of hours, but we need not wait here," Bra'tac said, answering his unspoken question. "The information will be transmitted to the H'tel whenever it is acquired. We may depart for Earth at any time."

"Let's go," O'Neill said.

When the H'tel entered Earth orbit it was met by the three Tauri warships and escorted by the two American vessels as the Kerensky kept its distance, either intimidated by the larger vessel or not sure of the Jaffa's motives. The Phoenix and the newly finished Icarus took up flanking positions alongside the pyramid ship as they circled around the planet towards China.

---

"How'd it go?" Landry asked O'Neill after he'd beamed down into the SGC.

"Like a charm," the higher ranking General answered as the rest of SG-1 met him and Mitchell in the briefing room. "But," O'Neill continued, "there are a number of unaccounted for Chinese that managed to gate offworld. They may have went to one of their other bases… "

"Or they could be running around who knows where," Landry finished for him.

"Right," O'Neill answered, a bit stunned at being interrupted.

"You think they've got other operations running?" Carter asked.

O'Neill shrugged. "Don't know. That's what I want you to find out."

"We've got the address they gated to," Mitchell explained. "With your permission, sir," Cam said, looking at Landry, "I'd like to get underway immediately before the trail grows cold."

"Permission granted. If China has other bases out there we need to find them ASAP."

"That's not all," Mitchell said.

"Kassa," Jack said when Mitchell left the moment to him. "There was loads of the stuff lying around… and some of it might have made its way back here."

Landry's eyes went wide. "The Chinese are drug trafficking now?"

"Possibly," Mitchell answered, looking at Vala.

"Well," she said sheepishly, "I did happen to notice a few reports on the news about something called 'Black Rain' being introduced onto your European continent. Supposedly it's twice as potent as anything else on the market."

"If it is a Kassa derivative," Mitchell explained, "we might be able to backtrack the flow… and by 'we' I mean the DEA or some other three letter agency."

"Since this is evil space corn we're dealing with," O'Neill told Landry, "I'm having the SGC take the lead. All government agencies and black ops personnel will coordinate through you."

Landry nodded. "Understood. I'll reassign SG-4 and 6 to coordinating rolls."

"Sirs," Mitchell asked, standing a bit straighter.

"Dismissed," Landry said, giving his leave. SG-1 left to prep for their offworld goose hunt.

"So," Landry said conspiratorially after they were gone. "What's our next move?"

"Bra'tac is returning the prisoners to China. In about six hours we're going to have a confrontation inside the I.O.A. We'll know then."

"Ah… I wish I could be there to see their reaction."

Jack raised an eyebrow. "Trade you?"

Landry laughed. "If only."

"Actually," Jack thought out loud, "why don't you come with. You can sit in the peanut gallery."

Landry hesitated, not sure if O'Neill was joking or not. He finally decided on 'not.' "Thank you, I think I will."

"Contact the Phoenix in five hours and have them beam you up. I'll meet you there."

"Will do, General."

O'Neill searched his pants pockets, frowning. He patted down his back pockets, then checked his jacket pockets. He finally found what he was looking for inside a hidden left breast pocket in his green jacket.

"Ah, there it is," he said, pulling out the small transmitter that was barely the size of a poker chip. He pressed the thumb-sized button and waited. Fourteen seconds later Phoenix's transport beam plucked him from the SGC.

---

"I assume this is the moment where you gloat over your recent victory?" Miss Shen, the Chinese Representative on the I.O.A. leading council, asked O'Neill, now in full dress uniform.

"Wasn't us," Jack said, only half suppressing a smile.

Shen frowned angrily. She'd only received her government's report an hour ago and hadn't had time to fully fume before being summoned into session. "I have eye witness reports of your presence onboard the Jaffa vessel."

"The Jaffa graciously allowed us two observers," O'Neill explained, "and they went to considerable effort to capture your people alive… and for a Jaffa that's saying a lot. I wouldn't count on such leniency next time."

"Next time?" Shen asked coyly.

O'Neill straightened behind the dais. Several American I.O.A. reps sitting in the gallery behind him shifted in their seats as well, including Landry. This was the moment of truth… or at least the first one… that they were going to come across.

"Either China voluntarily evacuates the other inhabited worlds you've stolen… or the Jaffa will take them by force. Master Bra'tac has given you one week exactly from the moment they returned your people. I suggest you not be late."

Shen leaned back in her seat. "It seems we have little choice… unless we recommit our nuclear arsenal to the defense of our colonies."

"Absolutely not!" Harkovli bellowed, the Russian's face turning red.

"That is not a viable option," Victor said in a less agitated voice.

"It would only serve to enrage the Jaffa," Louvere warned. "We can't risk further animosities."

"Relax fellas," O'Neill interjected. "I'm sure Miss Shen is well aware that a dozen of our nukes wouldn't be enough to penetrate their shields… she's just blowing smoke," he said irreverently.

"Correct me if I'm wrong, General," she said icily, "but did not our fighters damage the Jaffa vessel at Osser?"

"Scratched the paint," O'Neill confirmed.

"I believe our nuclear weapons would do considerably more damage," she said smugly.

Jack rolled his eyes. "The only reason your weapons hit paydirt was because Bra'tac lowered the shields so he could beam your pilots out before blowing your fighters to bits."

The Canadian Representative cleared her throat. "A sentiment of true friendship on their part that we would be fools to squander."

"Our weapons have no chance," Harkovli argued, "against the Ancient shield technology that the Jaffa now possess. Your statements here are nothing more than wishful thinking… if not bordering on delusional."

Shen eyed him vehemently but didn't respond.

"Well?" O'Neill demanded after a few moments of silence.

The Chinese Representative neatly assembled her papers and placed them back inside a single folder, tapped it twice on the desktop to even them, then laid it squarely down in front of her.

"You will have our answer in three days," she said as she rose from her seat and headed for the door. A half dozen other Chinese personnel in the gallery rose to leave as well.

O'Neill glanced across the panel of remaining I.O.A. reps. "One more thing," he said, getting her attention before she got to the door. "What have you been doing with all the Kassa?"

Shen was about to offer a retort, but thought better of it and just left the room with the door slamming shut behind her.

"What is this Kassa?" Raj Mesei, the Indian Representative on the 21 member council, asked.

"It's a type of narcotic," Victor informed the newer member.

"Looks like corn," O'Neill offered.

"China is growing narcotics on other planets?" Raj asked. "Did you know of this?"

"No we didn't," the British rep assured him. "The Americans were the ones to discover it."

"And there's a chance they might be bringing it back here," O'Neill said, dropping that bombshell.

"To sell?" Louvere asked.

O'Neill shrugged. "Beats me."

"They are way out of line," the New Zealand Representative said in half a whisper.

Jack pointed a swaying finger at all of them. "Don't think you all are off the hook either."

The I.O.A. representatives glanced at one another uneasily.

"If France is willing to cede all but one of our colonies," Louvere offered, "would that get us 'off the hook?'"

O'Neill rubbed his chin for a moment as he considered. "How many you got?"

"Four."

Jack bobbed his head side to side. "I think I can swing it… but we still have to dismantle the I.O.A."

"Russia has already made it clear that that is not an option," Harkovli reiterated.

"What would we have to fill the void?" Louvere asked, seemingly open to the idea.

O'Neill turned around. "Kelly?"

The junior I.O.A. rep that had been handling most of Coolidge's duties stood up from her seat in the gallery and gave Jack a thick folder, which he opened on the dais.

"First off, this business of everybody getting an equal share of decision making has got to go… some of you have zero experience in offworld affairs. Your naivet…  is dangerous when put into positions you haven't earned. From now on your countries are going to have to cut their teeth before they get to start playing with the big boys."

"Your tone is insulting," Harkovli rebuked.

"Not quite what I was going for, but ok," O'Neill said deadpan.

"Russia will not… "

Victor held up a hand. "Let him speak. I'm curious as to what the Americans have in mind."

"Right now we control the stargate," Jack began his diatribe. "We control the moon base. We control the only means of 304 production and most of the 302. We have the most personnel with offworld experience, not to mention offworld combat, and we're the ones that have developed the contacts with other worlds. They know us, they deal with us. You guys have been reaping the benefits of our hard work, then you start telling us what to do through the I.O.A., which has backfired time and again. To put it bluntly, you're newbs," he said, emphasizing that term.

"The fact that you've already ticked off the Jaffa and Tok'ra is clear evidence of your lack of real diplomatic skills. Not only did you break the rules we established to avoid confrontations like this, but you also got caught doing it, which goes to show you're not even good at sneaking around," O'Neill said, throwing his hands up in the air for emphasis of their ineptitude.

"We fooled you," Victor reminded him.

"Really… then why are we here having this discussion right now?"

Victor sat back in his seat.

"You guys don't have a clue what you're doing, and we've got enough enemies as it is. If Bra'tac hadn't been here when he was, Earth would be a dead planet. We dodged yet another bullet and you guys don't seem to care. The Aschen tried to wipe us out and all you can do is squabble amongst yourselves. We need to defend this planet properly, with a coordinated effort, because our nine lives are up. Sooner or later the bad guys are going to be the lucky ones and we'll just be dead."

"What sort of coordination are you suggesting?" Louvere asked.

"I've been working on a plan for a while now, for what would be the best case scenario. I didn't think it'd ever happen, but given recent events the status quo just won't do anymore."

"I think we can all agree to that," Mrs. Neville said.

"Speak for your own country," Harkovli reprimanded the Canadian.

"The framework is simple," O'Neill explained. "The SGC has operational authority over all offworld activities as well as Earth orbital defense. Your countries can contribute to the talent pool in the SGC where you are able and start building some experience. We expand the SGC over time into a multinational venture whose participation is based on merit and not politics."

"Eventually the colonization of other worlds will be facilitated by the SGC and your countries will gain a bit of liberty in that area, but for now all colonies will fall under direct SGC control until we can sort out this mess."

"Just for the sake of argument," Harkovli rumbled, "who would that put in command of the stargate program… General Landry or you?"

In the gallery Hank raised his eyebrows. O'Neill hadn't discussed this with him beforehand.

"Both… though we ultimately have to clear everything through the President."

"So Earth will take orders from the American President?" Harkovli laughed humorlessly. "I think not."

"If we are to contribute resources and personnel," Louvere said, exploring the thread, "would we have no say in their use?"

"Participation would be voluntary," O'Neill explained. "If you don't like something you can always walk."

"That's not quite what I meant, General," Louvere continued. "As more and more non-American personnel join the SGC, would your President still have final say?"

Jack considered that for a moment. It was a sticky question to say the least. "Best guess is that eventually the SGC would operate as a separate entity on US soil. Decisions involving multi-national resources would be made by the SGC and not our President. Decisions involving only US resources will always be the prerogative of the President."

Louvere nodded. "France will agree to that in principle."

"Canada may as well," Neville added, "but I must check with my government before we can go any further."

"I don't believe this!" Harkovli nearly exploded out of his seat. "You're giving them exactly what they want!"

"Each nation must act in our own best interests," Louvere explained. "Perhaps you should consider what course of action would serve Russia's future best."

"This isn't an east vs. west issue," O'Neill said, trying to throw him an olive branch. "It's about defending Earth."

"Under your leadership," Harkovli said, biting off each word.

"For the moment, we have the experience," Jack reminded him. "That won't always be the case."

"So you're saying the US's domination will end at some point?"

O'Neill nodded. "We can't let politicians of any country jeopardize Earth's security with petty games… that includes the United States. I don't trust our congress to know what to do out there any more than I trust you guys."

Several US diplomats in the gallery cringed, as did two US Senators in attendance, but neither of them looked particularly angered. In fact, one of them belatedly nodded his head in recognition of O'Neill's words.

"Do you have a formal proposal for us to consider?" Victor asked evenly.

"Nope," Jack answered. "Just some notes I've scratched down over the years."

"So all we have to go on is your word?" Raj asked.

"That's how we used to do it in the old days," O'Neill said pithily.

"Your lack of diplomatic understanding is profound," Harkovli said.

"Thank you," O'Neill said happily.

"I believe it may be us that are lacking in diplomacy," Louvere stated. "Or am I wrong in assuming that the Jaffa hold more to O'Neill's sense of personal honor than they do invective politics."

"You may have a point there," Haviar DeSoto added. "From the mission reports I've read while stationed in this post, most of the galaxy is more straightforward than we're accustomed to. Perhaps it is best if we leave the, diplomacy, in the hands of those in the SGC."

"Gracias," O'Neill added, nodding to the Spanish rep. "Most logical statement I've heard this decade."

"This is not a joking matter, General," Harkovli scolded him.

"Actually, I find this whole debate quite hilarious," Jack responded. "Because you really have no choice in all this. The only way you're gettin back out there is through us."

"Is that a threat?" Harkovli said raising his chin defiantly.

"Pretty much," O'Neill said, staring back. "You screwed up going behind our back. Now you're going to pay for it. You work a deal with us and you might, I stress might, get to keep some of your offworld assets. You don't play ball and you're grounded."

"You have no right to dictate terms," the Russian growled.

"Ambassador," Louvere interrupted. "Remember that the man you are berating is responsible for saving this planet from destruction no less than six times! General O'Neill can be trusted, even if his government cannot, and to put a rather blunt point on the matter… they are holding all the cards."

O'Neill held up eight fingers briefly for the Frenchman to see, but didn't say anything.

"Hero or not, Russia will not stand for this," Harkovli said firmly. "We have our own warship and need not grovel at the American's feet like the lot of you!"

"Hey! You started this when you went behind our back," O'Neill argued. "You had your shot, illegal as it was, and you blew it. Now we're trying things our way. You want onboard… great. If not, you can get into space the old fashioned way, because you ain't getting any more technology from us."

---

After the I.O.A. brass disbanded to consider their options, O'Neill was headed back to his house for a long delayed sleep after his 17 waking hours. He'd gone directly to Paris after returning to Earth and a brief refresher in Washington, and as it was he was having trouble keeping awake while driving out of the Pentagon's parking gate.

Something in his pocket started to vibrate, waking Jack up a bit further as he pulled out on the busy evening streets. He extricated his cell phone from his jeans' pocket and flipped it open, surprised at the calling number.

"O'Neill," he answered, now fully awake. "On my way," he said, putting his truck's turn signal on as he headed toward the White House.

---

"Mr. President," O'Neill said on entering the Oval Office in civilian clothes. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was present as well.

"General, come in," the President said, standing.

An attendant closed the door behind Jack as he stepped forward and stood at attention.

"I was told it was urgent?" O'Neill asked.

The President nodded. "I need you to personally go to stargate command to relay an order of mine, and I need it done within the hour."

Jack frowned. "What order?"

"We're moving the stargate out of Cheyenne Mountain to a location at these coordinates," the President said, nodding as the higher ranking General handed Jack a slip of paper. "Have the SGC deactivate the beaming jammers and transfer the stargate via the Phoenix."

"What?!" Jack asked/exclaimed.

"This is a direct order, General," the President said, looking him straight in the eyes. "You have one hour to transfer the stargate. If you are so much as one minute late you will be court-martialed for disobeying a direct order. Is that understood?"

"Why are we moving the gate?" Jack demanded, "and where is this?" he asked, holding up the piece of paper with the coordinates.

"There's no time for discussion," General Bowerton chimed in. "It is imperative that this happens no less than 59 minutes from now. We'll explain everything later."

"With all due respect, sirs… "

"Are you refusing to follow a Presidential Order?" the President cut him off.

"No, sir… "

"Then get moving. You're on the clock," the slightly taller man said, pointing at the door.

Jack stood still, looking back and forth between them trying to figure out what was going on. This felt all wrong.

"Now, General," Bowerton barked.

Jack held the man's gaze for a long two seconds then turned on his heels and left the room.

As he left the Oval Office O'Neill pulled the door shut a little hard, making a loud bang in the subdued evening environment of the White House.

"What?" he asked two secret service guards down the hallway as he walked by them. "Never heard a door slam before?"

Jack continued outside to where his truck was parked and angrily dove a hand into his duffle bag inside. He rummaged around for a while before finding his dirty dress uniform's pocket. He pulled out the transport chip and palmed it as he jogged back inside.

"Excuse me," Jack said, ducking past the security guards that had just let him out and around a corner into a deserted alcove, out of view. He pressed and held the transmit button and waited for the Asgard beam to transport him out of the stagnant, oppressive, infuriating governmental headquarters to and into surroundings more comfortable to him, though at the moment nothing was going to quell his roiling emotions

What had just happened?

"General," Ronson said from his command chair onboard the Phoenix, "welcome back."

"Give me a sensor sweep of these coordinates," O'Neill ordered, "and I need it ten minutes ago."

Ronson stood up frowning and took the slip of paper from him. "Where is this?"

"Beats me," Jack said as the bridge crew snapped into action.

"What are we looking for, exactly?"

"I honestly don't know," Jack said, his voice weird.

"Is something wrong?" the Colonel asked, sensing his off mood.

Jack just looked at him and shook his head in dismay, then cradled his forehead between a pair of fingers.

"Colonel," one of the bridge crew called out from the aft stations, "we have something."

"Where are we looking at?" Ronson asked.

"The Sahara Desert, southern Egypt."

Ronson glanced at O'Neill, but his face had scrunched up in frustration or worry… he wasn't sure which.

"Here," the Lieutenant said, pointing at a small screen. "Some sort of underground facility, several levels deep and over a mile wide."

"Those coordinates were to the inch, Lieutenant," Ronson said, his mood souring as well.

"Right here, sir, in the largest chamber."

She zoomed in and a familiar schematic manifested itself from the top down.

"Is that what I think it is?" Ronson asked.

Jack didn't answer. He stepped off to the side and leaned his forehead against a bulkhead, thinking hard.

"Looks to me like a copy of the SGC's gateroom," the Lieutenant offered.

"That's what I thought," Ronson confirmed. "What's going on, General?"

O'Neill didn't say anything.

"Jack?" Ronson whispered over his shoulder.

"I've got 53 minutes to make a decision," he said quietly so only Ronson could hear. "You'll know by then."

Ronson nodded, sensing something very wrong was going on. "What can I do?"

Jack hesitated for a moment, then made a snap decision. "I need to make a phone call."

Ronson nodded. "This way."

---

"George! Phone!"

"Thank you, dear," Hammond said from his camp chair next to the fire pit. He stood up and handed his hot dog on a roasting stick to his granddaughter. "Will you hold this for me? Grandpa needs to answer the phone."

"Sure," the five year old said eagerly, taking the seemingly heavy metal rod from him.

"Hold it steady… don't let it touch the ashes."

"I won't," she assured him as it wobbled over the flames.

"Good girl," he said smiling as he walked up to the door into his house.

"Who is it?" he asked.

"Military," his wife answered handing him the phone.

"Thanks," he said as she walked back outside to the grandkids. "Hello?"

"Sir, do you have a minute?"

"Jack?"

"Yes, sir. I don't mean to pry but I'm in a bit of a hurry. Are you free to talk."

"Anytime," Hammond said.

"In person?"

"Something wrong?" Hammond asked, sensing the change in his voice as well.

"I'm in one hell of a pickle, sir."

"Where are you?"

"Ten seconds away. I'd rather not talk about this over an open line."

"If it's that urgent, come right up to the door. We can talk in the den."

"Thank you, sir," Jack said a moment before he materialized three feet away.

"And here I thought you were driving up my lane," Hammond said, extending a hand in greeting. "Good to see you again, Jack."

"Likewise, sir," O'Neill said, his complexion paling. "I only have a few minutes."

"What's going on?" he asked, waving Jack toward a nearby room and the couch inside.

"I may have to disobey a Presidential order," he said, coming straight to the point.

All enjoyment of a friendship renewed drained from Hammond's face. "Go on."

"I got an emergency call on the way home telling me to get to the White House ASAP. As soon as I got in the door the President ordered me to move the stargate, handed me a scrap of paper with the coordinates, and wouldn't answer any questions. He said I had one hour exactly to get the gate moved or face court martial. As of now I've got 47 minutes left."

"Move it to where?" Hammond asked, aghast.

"I had the Phoenix do a sensor scan. It's a mockup of the SGC in Egypt."

"Egypt? How in the stars does he expect you to fly the gate there in an hour?!"

"He wants it beamed over."

Hammond considered that. "We can do that now?"

"Yeah," Jack said, dipping his head and grabbing the back of his neck with both hands.

"There has to be some sort of safeguards in place to keep our enemies from doing that to us, right?"

"We've installed jamming devices around the gate. I'm supposed to deactivate those personally."

"This is unbelievable," Hammond said, standing. "Someone is trying to steal the gate under the cover of darkness… and you said the President is the one who ordered it?"

"Yep."

"Does anyone else know about this?"

"General Bowerton was there too."

"The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Bowerton?"

"The same."

Hammond paced back and forth once. "You were right when you said you were in a pickle."

"Have any brilliant advice I could borrow?" Jack all but pleaded.

Hammond considered. "If they're doing this in a hurry, it's possible that they're afraid of causing a fuss. They know that we'd never willingly give up the stargate, so they're trying to get it out before anyone's the wiser."

"If I stall… "

"That might cause them to reconsider their plans, if enough people found out first… but then you're still facing a charge of disobeying a direct order, from the top of the chain of command no less."

"Well, if you're going to rebel, you might as well go big," Jack said, half attempting a joke.

"I still can't believe the President would be a part of this?" Hammond argued.

"It's not entirely out of character, based on some of the other things that have been going on, but I had no clue this was coming."

"That's probably by design… how much time did you say you had?"

Jack checked his watch. "45 minutes."

"I don't know what to tell you, Jack."

"Neither do I, sir," he said, leaning back on the couch and looking up at the ceiling.

"Whatever you decide, you'll have my full support," Hammond assured him. "I still have a number of contacts in high places. I'll get on the phone and see what I can do. Maybe a little sunshine on this mess will be all the cure we need," he said, retrieving his cordless phone from the other room.

"George… we both know that if that gate leaves US soil, it isn't coming back."

Hammond reluctantly nodded. "You're probably right about that."

"I'd bet my ridiculous paycheck that the President probably doesn't think Landry will deactivate the jammers on his order alone… at least not without making some phone calls first."

"You're the only one with enough clout to pull it off," Hammond agreed.

"And he hasn't left me enough time to do anything without violating his direct order," Jack said monotone, his mind elsewhere.

"What are you thinking, Jack?"

O'Neill blinked twice then looked directly at Hammond. "I'm damned if I do and damned if I don't. I can't let the President steal the stargate for the I.O.A. or whoever else is behind this… and I end up in jail if I don't."

"The I.O.A.?" Hammond said, his frown deepening.

"The President has bailed their asses out of the frying pan several times."

"Then this could be part of an international coup," Hammond thought out loud. "In fact, his election could have been engineered for this very act. No one can legally overrule the President… and the Congress can't remove him from office without telling the public what's really going on."

"I really didn't want to hear that," Jack said, his nerves ever more on edge.

"I've been involved in enough political games to recognize a few moves… and any President of the United States willing giving up the stargate is committing the political equivalent of a kamikaze run. He does this and his career is over one way or another."

"Where does that leave me?"

"In the hot seat… as usual," Hammond said, sitting down next to O'Neill.

"I wish it were, sir. I don't have anyone to shoot… or a gun for that matter," Jack said, patting the side of his jeans out of habit.

"Fate rarely comes at a moment of our choosing."

Jack frowned. "Patton?"

"Transformers," Hammond admitted. "The kids make me watch it with them over and over again."

"I'm so angry I'm sick to my stomach," Jack admitted. "I feel totally helpless."

"If you didn't have any control then the President wouldn't have needed you," Hammond reminded him.

"Meaning?"

"You can do something… it's just the consequences that are the problem."

"Are you telling me to cause trouble, sir," Jack asked, seeing the irony.

"I don't know of anyone more qualified," Hammond said, placing a hand on his shoulder. "In complete honesty… this may end bad no matter what you do."

Jack pulled a sock hat out of his pocket and twisted it between his hands. "You really think stalling will do any good?"

Hammond nodded cautiously. "If enough people are made aware of what's happening before the gate is actually moved, the President may be forced to change his orders… you might even be let off the hook."

"You don't sound too confident about that last part."

"I'm not. There's no one to plead your case to if the President doesn't bend under the pressure."

"He may still move the gate after I'm locked up."

"Then I suggest you put as much pressure on him as you can."

Jack managed a forced smile. "I wasn't looking forward to retirement part 2 anyway." He checked his watch. "Whatever happens, I've got to get the ball rolling now."

"I wish I could be of more help."

"You already have, sir. I knew from the moment he ordered me to do it that I wasn't going to… I guess I just needed to hear it from you to make sure I'm doing the right thing."

"Sometimes the right thing lands you in jail," Hammond warned.

"Been there, done that," Jack said, some of his swagger back. "Thanks," Jack said, saluting.

Hammond returned the salute. "Whatever happens, I want you to know it's been a honor serving with you… a headache at times, but a honor none the less."

Jack nodded. "Back at you, sir," he said, fishing in his pocket for his transport coin.

"Wait a minute," Hammond said as a thought occurred to him.

"Sir?"

"I'm not sure how much protocol has changed since I left the SGC, but there's one surefire way I know of to send a warning flare out to every agency and country associated with the stargate program."

Jack frowned.

"A lockdown," Hammond told him.

Jack's eyes widened. "I always knew there was the mind of a genius beneath that bald head. Gotta go, sir."

Two seconds later a white flash whisked O'Neill up to the Phoenix and out of Hammond's living room. With a precision developed through years of practice Hammond picked up his cordless phone and dialed the switchboard at the Pentagon.

"Colonel, we're receiving a transport request from General O'Neill," the Lieutenant at the left bridge control station reported.

"Permission granted," Ronson approved.

"Bridge, sir?" the Lieutenant asked.

Ronson nodded, and a moment later Jack appeared a few feet in front of them.

"You know," the Phoenix's commander commented, "I had thought these transport duties were going to be taken over by the moon base?"

"Right now that's the least of our problems," Jack said, not moving. "I need you to send me to the SGC."

"Still can't tell me what's going on?" Ronson asked.

"For your own sake," Jack told him. "You'll hear soon enough."

"Lieutenant?" Ronson said.

O'Neill disappeared in a flash of light.

"Any idea what's going on, sir?" the Lieutenant asked.

"No, but if it has O'Neill worried then it has to be something big."

"End of the world big?"

Ronson shrugged. "It wouldn't be the first time."

"No, sir, I suppose not."

"Keep those coordinates he gave us under surveillance," Ronson ordered. "He may not want to tell us what's going on, but that doesn't mean we can't try and find out for ourselves."

"Yes, sir."

Jack found himself in the middle of a deserted briefing room. "Hello?" he yelled. "Anybody?"

"General?" Landry said, stepping out of his office. "What brings you back to the SGC?"

"Trouble," Jack said plainly. "Where's SG-1?"

"Still offworld chasing down the Chinese… what's wrong."

"I have," Jack checked his watch, "32 minutes before I'm in violation of a Presidential Order to move the gate out of Cheyenne Mountain. After that all hell is going to break loose. I need to know how far we can extend the beaming jammers… over the entire SGC if possible."

Hank was taken aback. "They extend over the entire base automatically when the SGC goes into a lockdown."

"Perfect," Jack said, turning around and heading down the stairs.

"What was that about moving the stargate?" Landry asked, following in his footsteps.

"The President is trying to move the gate out of US custody before anyone notices. The President ordered me to have the Phoenix beam the gate out of the SGC within the hour."

"That's borderline treason," Landry whispered as they passed several other people in the hallway at the bottom of the stairs.

"Yes it is," Jack agreed as they stepped into the control room. "Who's the highest ranking team still on base?"

"SG-7," Landry answered.

"Get them up here," Jack ordered.

"Walter," Landry deferred.

"Yes, sir," the gate operator on duty answered. "SG-7 report to the control room," he announced over the base-wide intercom. "SG-7 to the control room."

"Hank, in a few minutes I need you to play receptionist when the phone line gets hot."

"It might help if you slowed down and filled me in first."

"There's not much more to tell," O'Neill said as he waited impatiently for SG-7 to arrive. "Might as well get the rest of the teams down here too," he added.

"Yes, sir," Walter acknowledged. "All SG teams report to the control room."

"Gate room," Jack corrected him.

"Check that. All SG teams report to the gateroom. All SG teams to the gateroom."

"And hurry," Jack added.

"Make that ASAP," Walter added.

"Can we get back to the part about the President ordering you to move the gate?" Landry pleaded.

"What?" Walter gasped, half turning around. "Sorry, sir."

"No, Walter, I had about the same reaction myself. Thing was he wouldn't let me ask any questions, nor did he bother to tell me where he wanted the gate moved to. He just gave me the coordinates and told me I had exactly 60 minutes to get it moved or face court martial. General Bowerton was with him when he gave the order, so I doubt this is an April fools joke."

"What coordinates?" Landry asked.

"I had the Phoenix check… turns out its some brand spanking new facility in Egypt of all places."

"Egypt?! I didn't know we had any bases in Egypt?"

"We don't… least not that I know of."

Landry thought fast. "Well who else would… "

"Now you're catching on," Jack noted.

"The I.O.A.," Landry said, biting off each letter.

"That'd be my guess."

"And the President is working with them… "

"Or for them," Jack added. "Doesn't matter right now. What does matter is that gate doesn't leave this facility under any circumstances. Do I make myself clear?"

"Perfectly," Landry echoed as SG-7 came running into the gateroom while its commander charged up into the control room.

"What's up?" Colonel Larson asked hurriedly, noticing General O'Neil's presence. "Sir," he added with a curt nod.

"Trouble, Gary," Jack said stepping over to him and grabbing his shoulder. He whispered in his ear.

"Quietly take your team and arm them for base defense, stunners only, then stand guard over the armory ready to take down anyone that tries to gear up without my permission over the radio. We've got an internal power struggle brewing and I don't know who'll take whose side."

Larson pulled back enough to look Jack in the eye. "You can count on SG-7 to have your back, sir."

"Thanks," Jack said as the Colonel left to get his men as the other SG teams began filling into the gateroom.

"If the President issued the order," Landry said quietly after Larson left, "then we're in a very sticky situation."

"I know," Jack said, way ahead of him. "We're violating the chain of command… but if we let the gate go, we're not going to get it back again short of going to war."

"True," Landry agreed. "Alright, how do you want to play this?"

"I'm the crazed General refusing the follow orders… you're the middleman trying to work out a solution while letting everyone know exactly what's going on and how it jeopardizes national security."

Landry nodded. "I can do that, but it leaves you holding the bag."

"As always," Jack muttered. "Walter… initiate a full lockdown of the base."

"Sir?...yes, sir," he said, getting his wits about him. A moment later the base alarm sounded.

"Make sure the jammers are up and stay up," Jack ordered Landry. "If they can beam us out at will this is going to be a very short standoff."

"Walter… " Landry began as Jack jogged out of the control room and met the on-base SG teams on the gateroom floor.

"Alright… listen up!" Jack said in full badass mode. "The President had turned traitor on us. Not forty minutes ago he ordered me to quietly move the stargate out of Cheyenne Mountain to what we think is an I.O.A. facility in Egypt. He gave me exactly one hour to get it beamed over or face court martial. I think he intended to catch everyone off guard and get the gate moved before anyone knew about it… but that didn't happen. I'm not moving the stargate. It's the single most important piece of our national security… hell, planetary security, that we possess."

"Right now the President is probably royally pissed off, and I'm not exactly sure what's going to happen. He's not going to get the midnight coup he expected, but if he is set on this course of action he may be willing to go to further lengths… possibly an assault on the SGC to deactivate the jamming devices preventing our ships from beaming out the gate. If you hadn't noticed, the base has just gone into lockdown and will stay that way until I'm assured that the President or others aren't going to steal the gate."

"Worst case scenario, he sends an assault force, in which case I need your help to keep them out. Technically he outranks me, but at this point we're past the chain of command. This is blatant treason and we cannot let this gate go," Jack emphasized by turning around and pointing at the heavy ring behind him. "Do you understand?"

The SG teams snapped to attention. "Yes, sir," they said in unison.

"Good," Jack said, nodding. He hadn't expected any less from the SG teams, but he hadn't felt secure until he'd heard it from them himself. "For any of you poetic types… and you know who you are… the SGC just became the Alamo."
