"I can't believe how well organized they are," Ford said.

"I know," Sheppard said in full agreement. "Ronon's got Green Team up to U.S. Army efficiency."

"Not that that's saying much," Ford joked.

"I don't know. Even a platoon of boot camp-fresh ground pounders would make mince meat out of Blue Team."

"Now that's really not saying very much," Ford said, extending his joke to Sheppard's men.

"Well feel free to offer up any suggestions."

"I already have," Ford argued. "You rejected them."

"They were extreme… to the point of self injury," Sheppard complained. "These are common folk that we're trying to train into soldiers. You gotta allow for a bigger learning curve here compared to Earth."

"Ronon doesn't seem to have a problem pressing his men."

"Ronon is sadistic," Sheppard argued.

"My point exactly."

Sheppard stopped walking and faced Aiden. "Alright, how about this. You can play antagonist and I'll play protagonist."

"Meaning I'm the drill sergeant," Ford asked. "and you're the CO?"

"Something like that," Sheppard agreed.

Ford nodded. "That could work, but we're going to have to set this up properly."

"What do you mean?"

"I'll have to give them challenges to face… and you'll have to be the one to teach them how to get through it."

"I think I see where you're going with this," Sheppard said as they started to continue walking back to the command post from the stargate. They'd just arrived to take their command shift opposite Brand and Ronon, who were both currently back in Atlantis. Striker had been in temporary command the past few days, but Sheppard didn't feel completely comfortable with him taking the reigns of a full training cycle just yet.

"You think my concern for my men is affecting my ability to rough them up?"

"Exactly."

"So, you want to be their worst nightmare so I don't have to?"

Ford smiled. "Yep."

"Hmm," Sheppard considered. "I wonder how Ronon manages to do both?"

"I hate to say it, but I think his Setidan training was better than ours."

Sheppard smiled. "I've been thinking about that since the day we started training the regulars. Kind of a tough pill to swallow… but it does give us the opportunity to learn a few things."

"Man, I wish I could have seen them when they fought the Wraith," Ford said, thinking out loud. "A whole planet full of Ronons… that'd be nuts."

"They're not all like him," Sheppard said, remembering the other Setidans they'd come across. "But they are a tough lot. I… " he said before disappearing in a blinding light.

"What the hell?" Ford said, glancing right and left out of reflex. He looked up in the sky and listened… but there were no darts. Besides, the light hadn't been quite the same, but either way Sheppard had been transported somewhere.

Ford took off at a run back to the stargate. With his enzyme enhanced muscles he made it back within three minutes, hurriedly dialed Atlantis, sent his security code, then ran through the portal to get help.

"Hi, John," Carter said kindly, almost an apology, along with a short wave.

"Hi, Sam," Sheppard said naturally, his shock gone. He should have expected this. O'Neill had warned them that they were coming, but how in the world did they find Yavin? "I'm kind of in the middle of something right now, so would you mind beaming me back down? We can talk later, say an hour or so?" he said sarcastically.

"I'm afraid that's not going to happen," Woolsey said, stepping into the conversation. Carter shot him a short glance, but the I.O.A. representative didn't see it.

"Woolsey," Sheppard said, his voice full of venom. "I should have known you'd be a part of this," he said, looking back at Carter. "But I didn't figure you for a turncoat."

"That's not fair, John," she mildly protested despite the fact that she'd expected as much. "I'm just following orders. You put yourself in this position, not me."

"Gee, thanks," Sheppard said irreverently. "That'll make those long nights in prison all the more bearable now, won't it?"

"You stole from the Air Force," Carter argued. "What did you expect to happen?"

"What I did," he corrected her, "was use the material available to me to aid our allies in the war against the Wraith, as we've done ever since we first set foot in Atlantis and allied ourselves with the Athosians. I didn't change anything. The I.O.A. is the one that did the changing."

"Perhaps so," Woolsey said, "but your actions were still in violation of I.O.A. mandate, not to mention U.S. military regs. You would have received a fair trial… if you hadn't broken security and fled Stargate Command."

"I did the right thing," Sheppard emphasized, "and I was being punished for it. End of story. You can wrap it up in whatever propaganda you like, but that doesn't change the truth. You were going to abandon every single Human in the Pegasus galaxy to the mercy of the Wraith… and we all know where that leads back to. And don't even try to deny it," Sheppard said, pointing an accusing finger at Woolsey.

"I don't deny anything," the man said, unshaken. "Our priority lies with Earth, not the Pegasus galaxy. Your actions, along with those of Dr. Weir, drew us into a war not of our own making. That in no way makes us liable for the outcome of that war or the fate of the Pegasus galaxy. Given that we did destroy several Wraith Hive ships during our few years here, the Pegasus natives should be thankful for our assistance rather than expect us to bail them out of their perpetual troubles."

"Their 'troubles'?" Sheppard said, incredulously. "You make it sound like it's their fault?"

"Well it's certainly not ours," Woolsey continued. "We have enough problems of our own to deal with. We can't logistically or ideologically commit ourselves to the task of defeating the Wraith, and to be frank, we never should have entertained those thoughts."

"But we can commit ourselves to ransacking every bit of advanced technology that we come across, despite the negative affects it will have on others, all in the name of good old Earth?"

"I wouldn't put it that way, but if you must, then… yes," Woolsey said without any trace of guilt.

"Why you… " Sheppard muttered, taking three quick steps up to the man and punched him in the face.

Woolsey fell to the ground, his nose gushing blood as the SF's ran up to restrain Sheppard.

"Enough!" Carter yelled. Reluctantly Sheppard stopped struggling against the superior muscle. "Lieutenant Vitterman, help Mr. Woolsey to the infirmary. And you," she said, turning her ire on Sheppard.

"And me what?" he countered. "I'm on my way to a holding cell, followed by a rigged trial and a damp, dark cell somewhere on Earth for the rest of my life. You really expect me to walk into that willingly?"

Carter glared at him, but didn't say a word. "Holding cell," she ordered.

The SF's began to drag him off the bridge. "Nice to see you too, Sam."

When Sheppard was out of sight she slumped down in her command chair, cradling her head in her hand.

"General?" Major Kelson said.

"Yes," she said, not looking up.

"We have a message from the Daedalus. Dr. McKay is requesting permission to ring over."

"Perfect," Carter muttered in disgust. She thought about denying him permission, but then again this confrontation was going to happen one way or another. She might as well let him find out about Sheppard now and get it over with. "Permission granted," she said, getting up from her chair. "Put us into a stable orbit and have the other ships do likewise. I'm going to meet McKay. You have the bridge, Major."

Ford burst into the gate room at a run and continued forward up the stairs. "Sheppard's been taken!" he yelled into the empty room.

Devonshire poked her head up into view above the second tier railing. "What?"

"I said Sheppard's been taken," Ford repeated. "On Yavin. We were walking side by side, then there was a flash of light, and he was gone."

Devonshire frowned. "You mean he was beamed up?"

Ford shook his head. "It wasn't a dart."

Devonshire looked at him as if he was stupid. "I meant an Asgard beam."

Ford frowned. "Why would the Asgard take him?"

"I didn't… what is wrong with you? The transport beams that we use on our ships, like, you know, the Daedalus or the Odyssey."

"Daedalus?" Ford said, remembering. "You mean the tech the Asgard gave Earth."

"Yes," Devonshire over emphasized. "Did it look like that?"

"I've never seen it," Ford told her.

"Oh," she said apologetically. "I guess you wouldn't have. It's sort of like a bright white light that zips up and down, depending on which way you're going."

"It was a white light," Ford confirmed.

Devonshire chewed on her lip as she thought. "Stevenson said he didn't want to be disturbed unless it was an emergency, but I guess this qualifies," she said, walking over to a communications panel. She pulled up a schematic of the city and zoomed in on Stevenson's quarters. She keyed the sound for his location only.

"Control room to Stevenson. We have a situation."

There was a long pause, longer than Devonshire was comfortable with and she began to worry about having interrupted him, but eventually his calm voice responded.

"What is it?"

"Sir, Ford has just returned from Yavin. He claims Sheppard disappeared in a flash of light. We think it might have been… "

"Keep him there," Stevenson said quickly. "I'll be right up."

"Okay… " Devonshire said to herself as the comm channel cut off from Stevenson's end. "I guess that was worth waking him up for."

"Claims?" Ford repeated.

Devonshire stared him down. "If you don't know for sure what it was, then 'claims' is the appropriate term."

"You make it sound like I don't know what I'm talking about."

"I didn't mean it that way."

Ford seemed to let it go. "He was sleeping in the middle of the day?"

She shrugged. "Beats me. I'd be taking a nap right now if I wasn't on duty."

"A nap?" Ford said incredulously. "Don't you have anything better to do?"

She smiled humorlessly. "Right now, Atlantis is a pretty dull place."

"The city has over a hundred gyms," Ford countered.

"I do my workouts in the morning," she told him. "In the afternoon I'm bored to tears."

"Flight training then," Ford countered as he tried to keep his nerves in check. He didn't just like waiting around while Sheppard was who knows where. "There are plenty of simulations to get you started."

"Hmmn, I hadn't thought about that. Is training all you do for fun?"

"Nowadays, pretty much," Ford admitted. "All the 'fun' stuff I did before seems pretty pathetic now."

"Such as?" Devonshire pressed.

"Well, there was this one time… " he began as Stevenson raced into the control room.

"That was fast," Devonshire said as Stevenson brushed past her and went straight for the long range sensors. He recalibrated them in a flash and generated a grainy picture of three contacts over Yavin. It took a moment for the computer to process their likely shapes and origins, but Stevenson already knew who they were.

"Find Ronon," he told Aiden. "I'm going to need the two of you geared up in less than an hour."

"What is it?" Ford asked him pointedly.

"A taskforce from Avalon. We knew they were coming, but I'd been expecting to find them before they found us. Somehow they stumbled across Yavin… unless they backtracked the regulars."

"Where's Avalon?" Ford asked. "And how would they know to track Sheppard's men?"

"Earth," Stevenson said, using the human name for their homeworld. "And I bet they put feelers out into the local populations to try and find where we went. From there that eventually led them back to Yavin."

"So why take him and not me?" Ford asked. "We were side by side."

Stevenson frowned. "I don't know." He turned to Devonshire. "Tell Larrin we're going to need the Tria," he said before running off into the city.

---

Stevenson arrived in the outpost on the forest world that Teyla had entirely to herself barely twenty minutes after he'd received the news about Sheppard. He quickly searched for Teyla within the terra, but found her mind somewhat distant.

Teyla, he said telepathically, but there was no reply. Either she didn't have the skills to reply or her transformation hadn't progressed that far yet.

Stevenson got a more precise mental location fix and ran out to her location. He had to pass through over a kilometer of forest before emerging onto the beach that ringed the island that the terra was located on. Teyla was on the water's edge, moving to and fro in an elaborate dance-like flow of positions that Stevenson recognized as an Alterran flexibility regimen.

He smiled as he approached her, pleased with the skill of movement that she was displaying… and her lack of clothes. His maleness aside, he took it as a sign of progress that she was abandoning human taboos and recognizing her body for what it really was.

Teyla, he said 'louder' this time, trying to establish a telepathic link.

Right on cue she jerked to sudden awareness, then looked visibly relieved when she saw him approaching and quickly began to walk forward to meet him.

"Did you say that out loud… or in my mind?" she asked, speaking Lingara, or as the humans called it, 'Ancient.'

"Mind… I see you've progressed to at least level three," he said, referring to the neural uploads that he'd left in the terra along with a myriad of other developmental training designed to bring her up to Alterran norms.

Teyla smiled. "Comprehensive level four," she informed him, "but I've reached level 17 in the self defense subsection."

Stevenson nodded curtly. "Good. You're going to need it. I apologize for interrupting your training… I know your transformation isn't complete yet, but I need your help."

Teyla's eyes narrowed. "What's wrong?" she asked, picking up on his tension either from past experience or a sliver of her developing empathic ability.

"Sheppard's been captured," he said, wasting no time.

Teyla set her jaw, then glanced down at her nude body. "I can leave as soon as I get dressed," she said, starting to walk off the beach back toward the terra.

Stevenson grabbed her arm, stopping her. "First things first," he said, sliding a large, intricate gauntlet onto her forearm. He slid a second identical one on her opposite arm, then held up his own for comparison.

"What are these for?" Teyla asked.

"Combat," Stevenson said simply. "They respond to mental commands. Observe."

Teyla watched as both pieces of Stevenson's forearm jewelry melted from their silvery forms and spread out over his body, expanding in size far more than volume would have allowed. Within twenty seconds he was covered head to toe in dark grey body armor that looked to be little more than a thin layer of liquid.

His head covering retracted, exposing his face. "The armor is made up of nanites. They are rigid, despite their fluid appearance, but they move in conjunction with your neural impulses. They offer no resistance to movement, rather they anticipate your actions and move along with your body. Otherwise they are rock solid and can easily protect you from blades and a moderate amount of kinetic energy. They will also absorb the energy from most stun weapons."

"Amazing," Teyla said, glancing down at her own jewelry. Her mind focused and her own armor slithered coolly over her body, clothing her in nanite armor, only hers was golden brown in color. Belatedly she realized it was the same color as the sand she was standing on.

"Yes, it will match the color of your environment if you wish," Stevenson explained quickly. "It also possesses a decent personal shield and wrist-mounted weapons," he said, referencing the small bumps covering both of their wrists. "One setting is for stun, which is all I want you to use. Try it now," he said, firing a small blue orb into the sand.

Teyla concentrated again, lifting her left arm and pointing it toward a small rock near the water's edge. An equally small green orb lept from her wrist, missed the rock low by a few centimeters, and exploded the sand beneath… launching the rock high into the air where it then fell crashing into the lake.

Stevenson shook his head. "That wasn't stun. Try again."

Teyla looked around and found another small stone. She raised her forearm in its direction and thought only about putting the stone to sleep. With that thought in mind, she loosed the weapon's energy, launching the blue stun orb that crackled harmlessly across the stone's surface, quickly dissipating its energy into the rock and the sand beneath.

"Good," Stevenson said, walking off the beach. "Practice as many functions as you can on our way back. You need to get familiar with the mental interface."

"Who took Sheppard?" she asked, firing another stun blast into the sand.

"Three ships from Avalon," Stevenson said, retracting his own armor back into the elegant forearm jewelry that he almost always wore. "They beamed him up from Yavin about half an hour ago."

"They came all this way to recapture him?" Teyla asked.

"They came here to reclaim Atlantis," Stevenson said, telekinetically pushing a tree branch out of their way. "O'Neill warned us they were coming, and I've been looking for them. It seems they found us first."

Teyla retracted her armor, leaving her nude once again, then just as quickly redeployed it. "What are you planning?"

"We're going to intercept and board their ships," Stevenson told her as they continued to walk back through the forest, though their pace was gradually increasing into a slow run. "I'll take one, Ronon and Ford will take the second, along with an escort of replicators… "

"Aiden Ford?" Teyla asked, surprised.

Stevenson nodded. "Long story. You can get reacquainted on the way. I need you to take the third ship. Incapacitate everyone onboard and confine them into holding areas."

"You mean drag them into holding areas," Teyla corrected him as she stopped experimenting and accelerated into a full run.

Stevenson easily matched her speed. "Yes. Don't leave anyone conscious, even if they surrender."

"I understand," she said, remembering that these were his former people and that it was possible that he still had some friends among them.

"We can afford to be generous when we have the advantage," he said, reading her thoughts. "If that wasn't the case, then we wouldn't hold back, no matter who they were."

Teyla smiled. She should have known better than to assume a bias on his part.

Within a minute they had arrived back at the terra and Stevenson led Teyla over to the obelisk inside. She frowned.

With a simple mental command Stevenson activated the transportation device. In a flash they were standing in front of its opposite number directly opposite the stargate.

Teyla raised an eyebrow. "And you made me walk."

"It's all about the journey," Stevenson reminded her as they walked up to the gate. He didn't bother with the nearby DHD. He dialed the address mentally inside half a second and the event horizon snapped into place inside the stargate.

"You're going to have to teach me that trick sometime," Teyla said, keeping in step beside him.

"It's all in the training program," he told her as they walked through.

---

"Larrin?" he asked after they ringed over to the Tria, which was still docked in one of Atlantis's six slips.

The ship's captain responded by touching the small device attached to her ear. "They're aboard. Take us up," she said to her small bridge crew, all of whom were Travelers, as she led Stevenson and a fully clothed Teyla out of the ring room.

By the time they reached the bridge, the Tria had already activated its anti-grav suspension matrix and released itself from the city's tractor beams that had been holding it aloft. It passed through the city's shield into the freezing atmosphere of Hoth, then rocketed up towards orbit on its primary engines.

When they reached the bridge, Larrin slid into the control chair, utilizing her recent gene enhancement to bring up a tie-in schematic from Atlantis's long range sensors.

"They've already entered hyperspace," Larrin reported.

"Move to intercept their line of flight," Stevenson ordered.

"That's going to be tricky," Larrin warned as Teyla walked over to Ronon and Ford smiling. "Our sensors don't reach that far in hyperspace."

"Anticipate their current course and get us near them. We can reacquire the trace then."

"Ok," Larrin said, unsure of their chances. "Entering hyperspace," she said as she mentally entered her best guess at an intercept point. The ship launched into flight on cue and the telemetry data from Atlantis vanished from above the control chair.

"Estimate two and a half hours to intercept," she said as she remained in the control chair to monitor their status… and to revel in the surge of power she felt whenever she sat in the chair. Larrin liked being in control.

---

The door to Sheppard's cell onboard the Odyssey opened with a groan and McKay slowly walked through. He glanced back over his shoulder with a none too happy glare at the guard then walked over to the table where Sheppard sat handcuffed to his chair.

A look of disgust crossed Sheppard's face. "You too?"

"Hardly," McKay mumbled as he sat down opposite of Sheppard. "I'm as much of a prisoner as you are," he said, glancing at his friend's handcuffs. "Well, maybe not quite that much, but I am here against my will."

"Oh really?" Sheppard said sarcastically. "Because it's beginning to look a lot like 'stab your friend in the back' day to me."

"You can blame Sam for that," McKay said with a mixture of dismay and disgust. "She's the one pushing this."

Sheppard's eyes narrowed. "Why?"

McKay crossed his arms over his chest. "You'd have to ask her that. O'Neill sent us out here to fail… somehow she didn't get the message."

"O'Neill did?"

"Orders from the President," McKay explained. "Then he twisted my arm to get me to come."

"How'd he do that?" Sheppard asked.

"It was a simple choice between this mission and retirement. I would have balked, but he said we'd abandon the idea if I could prove that it couldn't be done. Ahab up on the bridge has other ideas though."

Sheppard half laughed. "She really thinks she can take Atlantis?"

"Unfortunately yes," McKay said, frowning. "By the way, how did you know? Did she tell you?"

"I managed to put the pieces together," Sheppard said carefully. It seemed O'Neill was still on their side and he didn't want to get him into any trouble. "What are you guys planning to do anyway? The whole Wraith fleet couldn't get past the city's shield… do you really expect a 304 to have better luck?"

"Three, actually," McKay corrected him, "though it makes little difference. She plans to use a new weapon to disrupt Atlantis's shields enough to get a ring transmission through. They even brought along a small army for the occasion."

Sheppard sat back in his seat and laughed. "Whose brilliant idea was that?"

McKay coughed. "Mine, actually."

Sheppard glared at him. "Wait a minute… whose side are you on here?"

"O'Neill said if we could prove it couldn't be done we'd permanently abandon any ideas of retaking Atlantis. Disrupting the shield was our one and only chance, and I pointed it out like I was supposed to. Then Sam goes berserk and has spent the last year building specialized weapons for that very task."

"And I wonder who helped her do that?" Sheppard implied.

"Hey, if I thought there was even a small possibility of success I never would have suggested the idea, but with three ZPMs powering the city and a real Ancient at the controls there's no way in hell she's going to stand a chance. I thought she was intelligent enough to eventually figure that out and abandon the mission, but it seems her blondeness has gotten the best of her… either that or her ego."

"So you're saying you deliberately offered them a plan that you knew would fail?" Sheppard asked slowly.

"Of course," McKay said, slightly offended. "Did you really think I'd side with the I.O.A.?"

Sheppard raised his eyebrows. "I saw Woolsey on the bridge. I thought you said this mission came from the President?"

"Did a bit more than saw from what I hear… anyway, there's not much difference between the two anymore. The recent 'historic' election has left us with either a 'dupe-in-chief' or a 'conspirator-in-chief.' Either way the I.O.A. is pretty much running the show these days. They're the ones that really want Atlantis back. O'Neill argued to just let it go. Oh, by the way, they seem to want Stevenson just as much, if not more than they want the city."

"Fat chance of that," Sheppard mumbled as the cell door opened and Carter burst in.

"You sandbagger!" she verbally slung at McKay. "You've been holding out on us the entire time?"

"What? You were listening?"

"It's my job, McKay," she said with steel in her voice. "Yours was to help me devise a way to retake the city."

"I told you it wouldn't work, what more do you want?" McKay yelled.

"I guess a genuine effort is out of the question," she said sarcastically before turning to Sheppard. "I need Atlantis's address."

The former Colonel pulled against his cuffs. "Why in the world would I tell you that?"

Sam raised her chin. "In exchange for your freedom."

"What?" Sheppard and McKay said in tandem.

"You heard me. Tell me where Atlantis is and after we retake the city I'll arrange for you to 'accidentally' escape. Earth won't mount a retrieval mission for one man hiding in the Pegasus galaxy, especially since I have orders to bring Atlantis back to the Milky Way."

"Why weren't they going to do that the first time?" Sheppard asked irreverently.

"The two new ZPMs changed their mind," Sam told him. "They don't want to have anything to do with this galaxy or the Wraith. Once we're gone you'll be free and clear."

"To do what," Sheppard argued, "become Wraith food?"

"Would you prefer a prison cell for the rest of your life?" Sam countered.

"I don't believe this," McKay interrupted. "We're all on the same side here."

"We were," Sam said quietly. "But as we all know, not all stories have happy endings."

Sheppard glared at her. "Since when are you against doing the right thing?"

Sam shook her head. "It's not that simple anymore."

"It never was," Sheppard countered. "That never stopped you and SG-1 from defying orders. Don't forget, I read your mission reports."

"What we did, we did to safeguard Earth."

"What I did was to safeguard Pegasus."

"Sadly, that's not good enough," Sam said with genuine emotion. "Pegasus isn't our home, so not all people care for it as much as we do."

"We?" McKay objected. "You still count yourself in that group?"

"I've done all I can to help Pegasus," Sam angrily told him. "It wasn't enough. If I could disobey orders just one more time and those actions would save the people of Pegasus from the Wraith once and for all I'd do it in a heartbeat. You know that. But really, what can I do from the position I'm in?"

"You can turn us around and go home," McKay scolded her. "O'Neill said a year, and we're long past that."

"Earth needs Atlantis," Sam argued. "And the SGC needs to be the one to bring it back. If we do, we'll have more pull within the bureaucracy. Nowadays, with the Goa'uld defeated and the Wraith a galaxy away, the power of influence is our best weapon to right the wrongs of the I.O.A. But if I go rogue like Sheppard, I lose any chance of doing that. Earth will continue to go downhill until it becomes an enemy equivalent to that of the Goa'uld."

"Believe me," she continued, "I know what evil lurks within the I.O.A. I will not stand by and let it take over my home planet. And the only way I can fight it is from the inside. And to do that, I… we need Atlantis back."

"Is that the best excuse you came up with?" McKay mocked her. "You're never going to make a difference from the inside unless you're at the top of the food chain. Take it from a civilian who's been stomped on at the bottom of that hierarchy for years. The high ups in command do not take orders from those below them."

"Well perhaps this blonde has come up with a few ideas that the great Rodney McKay hasn't," Sam said sarcastically. "And, by the way, I'm not a civilian. I'm a General now."

"Temporarily," McKay reminded her.

"Even temporarily it gives me some additional pull," she said, turning back to Sheppard. "For instance, the ability to arrange for your escape."

"What about the others on Atlantis?" Sheppard asked calmly. "You going to let them go too?"

Sam swallowed. "That'll be harder. But as long as I get the city back, I can probably swing it."

"Including Stevenson?" Sheppard asked pointedly.

"No," McKay answered for her. "The I.O.A. wants their guinea pig back."

Sam turned on him with the harshest glare she had.

"Oh, you didn't think I knew about that," McKay said, holding up amicably under that stare. "It's a small ship and word gets around. Especially when you hold your fireside chats with Woolsey in public places."

Sam ignored him. "I can't promise anything for Stevenson."

"All he did," Sheppard reminded her, "was stick his head in the Repository."

"Against standing orders," she countered.

"So demote him," he argued. "That doesn't warrant life in prison."

"I know," Sam agreed. "But it's not up to me."

Sheppard turned his head in disgust, then dropped his eyes to the floor. "Va, Jo, Fin, Sa, Ta, Ra."

"What?" Sam asked.

"That's the address for the planet Atlantis is currently on."

Sam cringed. "That doesn't really help me unless you can write it down."

McKay looked at him, wondering if he'd lost his mind too.

"What, you guys don't know how addresses work?" Sheppard said, greedily mocking them. "I'm not even a scientist and I know."

"Stevenson taught you that?" McKay asked evenly. His world was turning inside out.

"That and other things," Sheppard said. "Uncuff me and I'll write down the address for you neanderthals."

Sam nodded and walked back to the door, motioning to the guard outside who had the handcuff keys. When her back was turned, Sheppard looked at McKay and gave him a quick wink.

Inside McKay nearly jumped for joy, but he managed to keep his elation in check. He knew Sheppard wouldn't blithely give up Atlantis's location, not even to save himself. Sam should have known that too, but apparently she'd gone too far to the darkside to be able to see past the politics and self interest that was the lifeblood of the I.O.A.

"Could you hurry it up?" McKay annoying said just to add to the subterfuge. Sheppard had a plan, and Rodney needed to be ready to help him when the time came. Screw the I.O.A. and screw Earth. He'd had enough… and while he might be a whiny, insecure, self absorbed scientist he was still a man and there were some lines that he just would not cross… and betraying a friend was one of them.

As the guard unhandcuffed Sheppard and he followed the threesome out of the cell he realized that whatever was about to go down would probably kill his engagement with Jennifer… if their 15 months apart hadn't already done so.

No… if he went along with this insanity any longer then he didn't deserve her anyway. He'd find some way to get a message back to her. Right now, he concluded, a man has got to do what a man has got to do, and to hell with the consequences.

He'd find some way out of this mess later… and with a clear conscience. He was, after all, a genius.

Sam sat in the Odyssey's command chair as her taskforce moved through hyperspace toward the address John had provided. Woolsey was still indisposed and Sheppard was back in his cell, with McKay keeping him company. Aside from a few bridge staff quietly going about their work she had a moment alone with her thoughts as she stared out at the blue/white hue of hyperspace.

Something was nagging her about Sheppard. She'd expected him to take her offer after a bit of indecision, quickly followed by the realization that a lifetime in prison was his only other viable option… but something about it just didn't feel right.

Maybe she had been expecting him to hold out longer, make her sweat for a while. He'd made the only logical choice, and she knew he was a lot smarter than he usually let on, but still…

She half wondered if the address he'd given them was bogus, but then he'd still be a prisoner given that Sam had only agreed to let him go after Atlantis was retaken.

Then again, maybe she was just feeling guilty about her part in all of this.

Sam shook off the thought. She'd been through the logic of the situation many times before, each of which ended with the same scenario… Sheppard in jail, Atlantis back in Earth's hands, Stevenson in the hands of the I.O.A.

That last bit bothered her even more than the rest. Sheppard had chosen to defy orders, same as all those that stayed in Atlantis with him. Stevenson, on the other hand, had been changed by alien technology, so his actions weren't entirely his own. And to top it off, everything that he'd done warranted prison… not experimentation.

"General Carter," Captain Norris politely interrupted her introspection.

"Yes, Captain?"

"We're picking up another vessel in hyperspace directly behind us on the edge of our sensors."

Sam frowned. "What's its heading?" she asked, wondering if they'd stumbled onto the Wraith.

"It's trailing us on an identical heading," the Captain said worriedly, "and closing."

Sam stood up and looked at the hyperspace sensor screen herself. "Oh that can't be good."

"Ma'am?"

"Stay on course. The odds of us actually hitting each other in hyperspace are nil. At the speed they're going they'll pass us by long before we reach Atlantis."

"What if they follow us there?" Major Kelson asked from the opposite bridge station.

Sam shook her head. "Aside from a replicator-infested ship, every hyperdrive technology we've encountered maintains a constant speed once in hyperspace. The only way this contact could follow us is to drop out of hyperspace, then reenter at a slower speed. Actually, I think that's how the replicators managed it too, only using microsecond transitions between the two dimensions."

"Why would they do that?" Norris asked as they both continued to watch the contact 'blip' on the screen.

"They were in the process of upgrading the hyperdrive while in flight," Sam said, remembering back. "A microsecond translation back into realspace would theoretically be enough to reinitialize the hyperspace 'bubble' at a new inertial speed. Other than that, I have no idea how they managed it."

Kelson blinked twice. "I thought it took longer than that for a hyperspace bubble to fully degenerate."

"It does," Sam said, her eyes still on the contact as it got ever closer. "As I said, I don't fully understand how they did it."

"And the Wraith?" Kelson asked.

"Not from what we've seen of their technology."

"Then what are they doing?" Norris asked.

Sam cringed. "I don't know."

On the sensor screen the contact was nearly to them, but the more precise trace that Norris performed indicated that it was going to pass high above them by a few million kilometers. The blip merged on the screen with the dot that represented the three Earth ships…

Sam caught herself on the Captain's chair as the ship suddenly and violently exited hyperspace. "Report!" she said, clawing herself back into her chair.

"We're back in realspace," Norris said quickly. "So are the Daedalus and Apollo."

"What the hell happened?" Sam asked rhetorically. "I want a hyperdrive diagnostic, now."

"Contact!" Norris yelled out. "Two million klicks and closing fast!"

"Shields up," Sam ordered. "Bring us around next to the Daedalus. Open a channel to our ships."

"General," Caldwell's voice came through before she could speak, "we've suffered some type of hyperdrive malfunction. Whatever knocked us out has disabled our drive."

Sam looked to Norris. The Captain nodded in confirmation. Their hyperdrive was offline as well.

"Copy that," Sam said over the open comm between all three ships. "Colonels bring your ships into formation alongside the Odyssey. We have incoming."

"We see it, Odyssey," Ellis's voice said evenly. "What are your orders?"

"Stand by weapons, but let them make the first move," Sam said as an image enhancement popped up on Kelson's screen. The Major turned to the General with a look of fear. "It's an Ancient warship."

"What?" Sam asked aloud.

"Could it be the replicators?" Ellis asked over the still open comm.

"If it is," Caldwell interrupted, "we're more than a match for one ship."

"Let's not make any assumptions," Sam urged as the Aurora-class warship decelerated before them. "Major, try and establish communications with that ship."

"They're firing drones!" Norris warned.

"Weapons hot!" Sam ordered as the Earth ships began to move evasively. "Return fire!"

An explosion in Odyssey's aft rocked the ship, followed quickly by a second, then a third.

"Sublight is gone," Norris reported. "The drones are getting through our shields!"

"Readjust shield frequencies," Sam snapped, jumping out of her seat to do it herself.

Another explosion rocked the ship as the Odyssey returned fire with its Asgard beams. Two lances of blue impacted the Ancient ship's shields… and were completely absorbed, along with several more shots from the Daedalus and Apollo.

"Shield emitters have been destroyed!" Norris screamed panickly.

"Daedalus, Apollo," Sam yelled into the air. "If you still have engines get the hell out of here now! That's an order!"

Outside the ship half a dozen Asgard beams impacted the enemy ship, but again they were all absorbed by its shields. Carter couldn't understand how it was holding up against the barrage. The identical replicator ships they'd faced over Asuras hadn't been this strong.

"Fire every nuke we've got!" Sam yelled. "All tubes."

"Aren't we a little close for that?" Kelson asked, amidst another explosion somewhere on the ship.

"We're at minimal safe distance," Sam said, not feeling like giving explanations in the heat of battle. "Fire now!"

A dozen missile plumes shot out from the smoking Odyssey, mirroring those coming from the Apollo that had been launched only a moment earlier. They raced in toward the Ancient ship as more sporadic drones passed them by halfway between the ships.

Small golden spurts erupted from the enemy ship, picking off some of the missiles. More followed from the port side of the Aurora as it utilized its rarely used energy weapons to down the incoming missiles… but it didn't get all of them.

Four slid past the counter-fire. Three of those were taken out in the last seconds by swiftly moving drones… but the fourth hit and detonated against the forward shields.

Sam covered her eyes against the glare that the auto-darkening viewport couldn't block out. It readjusted to transparency faster than her eyes did, but when her vision had adequately returned she saw the enemy ship just as it had been. It's forward shields still absorbed the incoming Asgard beams, though there were less being fired than before.

Another shot rocked the ship.

"Port battery destroyed," Norris reported, aghast.

Sam looked at the Apollo as it made a strafing run close in on the Aurora. It fired its Asgard beams and rail guns at nearly point blank range to no avail. A single drone lept out from the ship and finished off the Apollo's already damage sublight engines. The ship listed and flipped over as its momentum carried it past the hull of the Ancient warship.

A small white beam lept between the two ships for an instant, then disappeared. A moment later another one stretched out to the Odyssey.

Norris looked up to her with wide eyes in the eerily quiet bridge. No more drones were being fired, and all weapon systems on the Odyssey had been destroyed. "The rings have been activated."

Sam immediately punched the intercom control on her command chair. "Intruder alert. All security teams to the ring room!"

---

"Step inside," Ronon said, standing back to back with Ford at the center of the Tria's rings. Four replicators, all male in appearance, filled the excess spaces around them in a tight cluster. Ronon nodded and Malcolm, one of Larrin's crew, typed in the sequence to activate the rings.

The circular beams sprang up from the floor around them… the was a wash of light… then the rings retracted into the floor and they found themselves standing in the Daedalus next to two of her crew wielding sidearms.

The two replicators nearest the guards silently raised their stun pistols and shot the two men, but not before the leftmost guard fired a round into and through one of the replicators. The nanites cells slowed the bullet, taking minute damage from the impact, but they did not stop it completely. It emerged from the replicator at a slower speed, then pinged off Ford's personal shield.

Aiden glanced down at the shield gauntlet that he wore on his right forearm. It was heavy as hell, but well worth it.

Ronon didn't say a word, he merely pointed to the door and his personal replicator walked forward, raised his weapon, and swung into the hallway beyond. It fired two shots before Ronon poked out behind it, covering the opposite direction.

No crew in sight, save for the one female that lay on the floor five meters from the group. Ronon waved the others out of the ring room and pointed Ford in the direction of the woman, while he went the other way. The replicators split between them.

The Setidan's group operated with Ares on point and the new replicator, which he'd named Oronat, bringing up the rear. Ronon kept to the middle, intent on being the primary shot while Ares' mission was to draw fire for him to respond to.

The tactic was called Trinary, and it required the threesome to be fast on their feet at all times. They could not stop, not delay, not separate. It was one of the earliest combat strategies taught to Setidan tactical squads and the basis for the more advanced formations they would learn in later years.

Ronon had Stevenson upgrade his personal replicator with the Trinary and other combat strategies, and for the purpose of this impromptu mission Ares was transmitting orders to Oronat whenever his default programming was lacking. Together the three moved quickly and efficiently through their section of the ship on the way to the bridge.

Their killcount was at twenty two… though technically that term was inadequate, given that none of the Daedalus's crew was actually dead… when they encountered their first real obstacle… a sealed bulkhead.

"Ares, open the door," Ronon ordered, reversing his line of sight as he backed himself up against the wall to the right of the door. That way he could cover the rear and be ready to spring into the corridor on the other side without making himself a target for whoever was waiting for them.

Ares reached a hand up to the lock and his nanites dispersed from his hand. They chewed apart the lock then returned to form his five digits, which then wrapped around the handle and pushed the door open.

A hail of bullets flew through the opening and Ares, but the replicator charged through, stunning everyone in sight. Ronon let him have five seconds to himself then pulled himself around the corner and into the line of fire. A quick glance revealed several bodies on the floor with several many more personnel down the hallway firing panickly with their P-90s.

Ronon fired two quick stun blasts as he moved through the door, his boots crunching on the damaged nanites dropping off of Ares. Oronat followed him, as per instructions, but didn't fire. He kept his attention on the corridor behind them in case they should be flanked and would only fire ahead if one of the others became incapacitated.

Between the nearly immune replicator and the shielded Setidan, the Daedalus's onboard troops didn't stand a chance. Despite the fact that they looked outfitted for ground combat, all of their armor and weaponry hadn't been enough to save them. Only Stevenson's orders to take them alive had done that.

Ronon did wonder, however, what they had been planning. The bodies he was stepping over were those of soldiers, not standard 304 crew.

He shook the thought off and focused his attention ahead. The bridge wasn't far off.

---

Ronon saw and heard three shots pass through Ares as he walked out of the connecting corridor and onto the bridge. More dust fell from the replicator, but his gun arm remained intact and fired quick, precise shots into whom Ronon couldn't yet see.

The traveler-made pistol that Ronon favored tracked Ares line of fire as its owner rounded the corner and had his first full view of the bridge. He saw two more bridge crew drop… as well as Colonel Caldwell fire another couple rounds through Ares from his sidearm.

Ronon's gun tracked toward the Daedalus's commander and he managed half a grin as he pulled the trigger. Had he delayed any further Ares would have got to him first, but Ronon was pleased to have been the one to knock the arrogant ass backwards over the pilot's station and onto the floor with one beautiful orange stun blast to the chest.

The grin still on his face, Ronon keyed his wrist bound communicator. "Ford?"

"Standby," Aiden's voice came back. Ronon waited a long thirty seconds before he responded again. "Engine room secured," he reported.

"We have the bridge," Ronon told him. "Leave one of your replicators to stand guard, then take the other and sweep the ship."

"Roger that," Ford said.

Ronon rekeyed his communicator. "Commander Larrin?"

"Tria here," her voice came back immediately. "What's your status?"

"Bridge and engine room secure," he reported. "We're currently sweeping the ship for stragglers."

"Good work," she said positively. "Stevenson and Teyla have already secured the other ships. I'm sending over a crate of restraints for the crew. It should be in your ring room within thirty seconds."

"Copy that. Do you want anything special done with Caldwell?"

"Who?" Larrin asked.

"The ship's captain," Ronon told her.

"No. Keep everyone onboard for now. Stevenson said he has a few things to take care of before we start transferring the crew."

Ronon raised an eyebrow. "What are we doing with the ships?"

"He didn't say, though right now they're little more than floating boxes. We had to slag most of their primary systems. By the way, check on your ship's life support."

Ronon hadn't thought about that, and did a quick systems check. He didn't understand half of what he was looking at, but with a little help from Ares he confirmed that the Daedalus's life support systems were still functional.

"We're good," Ronon said. "Any further orders?"

"None at the moment. Just keep a lid on the crew and sit tight until he tells us what he wants us to do."

"Got it," he said, cutting the comm. He pointed to the crew. "Pick them up and follow me. Two at a time if you can."

The two replicators easily scooped up two crewmembers a piece, carrying one per shoulder. Ronon dipped down and hauled Caldwell's body over his shoulders. He led the way to the mess hall and began depositing the crew there, with Oronat left behind to watch over the bunch. Minutes later when the first of the crew began to awake the replicator shot them again, and continued to do so until Ronon had cleared the ship and locked the mess hall door shut.

Oronat was then ordered to stun anyone trying to leave the room, allowing them to return to consciousness so long as they stayed put. It took two failed attempts by the crew to escape before they decided to give it up and do just that.

Outside his cell, Sheppard and Rodney could hear the sounds of battle as the ship rocked from what were obvious hits to the hull, though there were no windows around to confirm it.

"We can't be at Atlantis already," McKay said.

"No… " Sheppard said, looking up at the ceiling as if somehow he could see through it, "but I'd bet you twenty bucks I know who it is."

Another hit nearly knocked McKay out of his chair as the lights dimmed and the artificial gravity cut out for half a second. Off balanced Rodney slid out of his chair and landed hard on his butt. For a moment Sheppard was almost glad he was handcuffed to his chair… almost.

"Who?" McKay asked as he pulled himself back into this seat, briefly rubbing his behind before he sat down.

"Friends… " Sheppard told him. "And by the sound of the damage being done, I'd guess quite a few of them."

"What friends?" McKay implored him.

Another hit rocked the ship and Sheppard didn't figure he needed to hide anything anymore. "Travelers."

"Travelers? Why would they come after you? I didn't think that chick liked you that much."

Sheppard glared at him. "They signed on to Stevenson's payroll a few months ago. When I left Atlantis there were 63 of their ships in orbit."

"I thought you said we weren't at Atlantis yet?" Rodney said, stunned.

Sheppard shook his head. "That address I gave Sam wasn't for Atlantis, but its close. Close enough for the city's long range proximity sensors to pick us up long before we get there."

"You set her up?" Rodney asked, thoroughly pleased.

"Yep," Sheppard said as the explosions stopped.

"What do you suppose that means?" Rodney asked. "They won or we won?"

"Who's we?"

"Sorry. I meant Sam's guys… though technically since we're on her ship, if we get blown up then we lose too."

"I don't think that's the idea," Sheppard said, straining to hear. "I thought I just heard gunfire."

"Really?" Rodney asked, falling silent. He couldn't hear anything for maybe a minute, then the faint sounds of a firefight became undeniable… and increasing in volume.

McKay picked up his chair and moved it around behind Sheppard, then sat down again.

"What are you doing?"

"Well, if whoever is boarding the ship is looking for you they might not know that I'm on your side… and I don't want to get shot the moment they come through the door."

"So you thought you'd use me as a shield?" Sheppard said sarcastically.

"Well they're not going to shoot you, are they?"

"I hope not," he said just as a whine from an energy weapon muffled its way through the door, followed quickly by a thump.

"Was that the guard?" McKay whispered.

"I think so," Sheppard answered, a bit curious as to what was going on but happy none the less.

The door to their cell opened and a pure black figure walked into the room. Suddenly McKay felt himself lifted out of his seat by an invisible force.

"I'm with Sheppard… " he screamed in girlish fear.

"He is," John said, guessing as to who he was talking to.

"So he is," Stevenson's voice answered. The metal on Sheppard's cuffs broke in two and Rodney was released back onto his feet.

"Sweet," Sheppard said, standing up and stretching.

"Keep back," Stevenson said through his opaque faceplate. "I haven't secured the ship yet."

"Want some help?"

"No," Stevenson said, turning around and firing a blue orb from his wrist down the hallway.

"Stay here," Sheppard told Rodney as he sneaked a peak out of the cell after Stevenson was gone.

"Where are you going?"

"To find a weapon," Sheppard answered, running outside.

"Well don't leave me!" McKay whisper-yelled, following behind him.

He caught up to him two sections over, where he saw Sheppard retrieve a Zat from one of the bodies on the floor. "I told you to stay put," he scolded him.

"And that guy told you to stay put...you didn't," McKay objected.

"I know what I'm doing," Sheppard countered. "Stay behind me."

"Right," Rodney said in total agreement. "Don't I need a weapon too?" he asked as they began to sneak forward past the trail of bodies Stevenson had left.

"No… I don't want you shooting me in the back."

"I wouldn't do that."

"Not on purpose," Sheppard amended. Up ahead he heard a mechanical noise, quickly followed by the doors on an elevator shaft opening.

He fired his Zat the moment he had a shot, barely giving him enough time to notice that they were indeed Odyssey personnel and not someone Stevenson had brought along with him.

The two men and one woman crumpled to the ground inside the elevator. Sheppard covered them for a second then jogged forward cautiously. He wasn't sure if they'd all received a full hit, and he knew that two would kill them. When he finally stood over the three crewmembers he studied them for a long moment then withdrew his Zat. They were out cold.

He turned away from the elevator only to have his feet swept out from under him by one of the 'unconscious' men.

It was the woman actually, and she'd caught Sheppard completely off guard. She wrestled him into a submission hold, then was knocked over when Rodney decided to pile on… literally.

Sheppard had the wind knocked out of his lungs by the extra weight smashing down on top of him, but McKay had managed to free the Colonel's left arm. He used it to gain leverage over the woman and, with the help of McKay's bulk pinning her to the ground, he was able to get the upper hand.

He retrieved the Zat from the ground nearby and held it on her. "Stand down!" he ordered. "I don't know how much of a hit you took, but two is supposed to kill a person. Do you really want to take that chance?"

The woman gritted her teeth, but eased her hold on Sheppard's right ankle and Rodney's neck. The scientist rolled off her and dramatically savored his next few breaths of air.

Sheppard kicked himself free and stood up. He motioned for her to do likewise.

"I know you," he said, unable to place the name.

"You should," she snarled back. "I was part of Atlantis's security division before you went rogue."

"Morris… " he said, remembering. "Walk."

She did as bidden and they followed the trail of bodies all the way to the bridge. When they got there Stevenson was nowhere to be seen and all the bridge crew were unconscious… including Carter.

Sheppard pulled a sidearm off the ground and held it on Morris instead of the Zat, which he tossed to Rodney.

"Thanks," he said, holding it upside down. "Where's the trigger?"

Sheppard rolled his eyes. "Never mind. Put it down before you shoot yourself."

"What? I can do this. Just show me where the… " he said as he accidently fired the weapon sideways into one of the bridge stations, shattering the screen in a shower of sparks as the electronics overloaded. "Don't say it!"

Sheppard held his tongue, but pointed his finger at the ground. Reluctantly Rodney set it down on the floor ever so gently. A moment later Stevenson walked back onto the bridge.

"There you are," Sheppard said, relieved. "You missed a few."

Stevenson shot the woman unconscious. "So I did."

Sheppard raised an eyebrow, but didn't say anything. "What now?"

"The destabilization pulse temporarily knocked out their hyperdrives, but the primitive designs may have been damaged in the process. If they are I'll either have to repair them or have the Tria tow them back to Atlantis one at a time."

"Sounds good. What about the crew?"

"Larrin's got the cargo holds set up as detention areas. We can start transferring the crew over once the other ships are secured. You can head on over with your friend now, if you want."

Sheppard motioned toward Carter. "I'll carry Sam back."

"Fine," Stevenson said, slightly miffed at the mention of her name, "but she goes in the hold same as the others."

"Agreed," Sheppard said, lifting her up into his arms. He repositioned her head so it leaned on his shoulder instead of falling backwards at an uncomfortable angle. "Come on Rodney."

"I can stay and help you with the hyperdrive," he offered as Stevenson walked off the bridge.

"He doesn't need help," Sheppard said, carrying Sam off. "Come on."

---

After verifying that the other strike teams had accomplished their missions and that none of the Odyssey's crew were still at large, Stevenson made his way down to the Asgard Core room.

He activated the systems and slid his hands over the Asgard designed interface. He pulled a quick systems analysis and confirmed that the Asgard's legacy hadn't suffered any damage in the attack. He ran his fingers over the edge of the control panel slowly, getting a brief premonition from the touch. There was something important here, as he'd always suspected.

Stevenson released his touch and walked off. Precognitive abilities had been common among the Alterra… as had been the numerous misinterpretations and outright false predictions that prevented any meaningful forecasting of future events. They'd eventually tied some of the misinformation to a minute symbiosis between the minds of similar individuals in alternate realities.

Some Alterrans had become so adept, so in tune with their counterparts that they were able to see snippets of their lives, which in some cases mirrored their own. It was those that did not that led to erroneous prognostications… and the eventual development of a mental block against such interconnectivity between themselves and their counterparts.

But even with that mystery solved, there had always been a little extra intuition that popped up regularly that could never be scientifically explained. It was commonly held that such things weren't explainable simply due to the fact that the Alterran civilization hadn't advanced its understandings of the universe far enough to comprehend such things. The idea of 'magic' was non-existent, but given Stevenson's unique situation and his knowledge of such things in Earth cultures… he did get the feeling that these intuitions were more than just unexplained science.

Perhaps that's just because they were new to him, but regardless he wasn't going to ignore them… nor was he going to trust their accuracy. He considered them to be hunches, and played them as such. As for this recurring hunch, he had little doubt that it would pan out. The Asgard had entrusted the humans with the core for a reason… and he guessed there was more to that reason than they had told them.

Even so, the discovery of that secret would have to wait until he dealt with the humans. After which, he'd have plenty of time to search the depths of the database… and try to discover how exactly the Ascended Empire had managed to kill them.

---

"General?" Sam heard someone ask from above her.

Carter blinked her eyes again, this time clearing her vision and making out a pair of faces above her.

"General?" Caldwell repeated again, helping her to sit up slowly.

"Colonel?" she asked, her head pounding. She glanced around, shaking off the disorientation from being stunned. "Where are we?"

"On the Ancient warship would be my guess," he said, sitting down on the cargo bay floor beside her. "I woke up about ten minutes ago."

"I take it the same black warrior got you to?" Sam said, holding her hand against her forehead.

"No," Caldwell said angrily. "Ronon Dex was what got to me… and what I could have sworn was a replicator."

Sam's mind suddenly caught up to the situation. "Did you say replicator?"

"That'd be my guess. I fired several rounds straight through before Ronon stunned me."

"That's not what happened on the Odyssey," she told him, trying to stand up then thinking better of it. "A person, wearing some type of black, liquid armor took over the ship."

"Just one?"

Sam nodded, suddenly regretting the motion. "We tracked his progress from the bridge. There was just the one. He had some type of golden plasma weapon. It burned right through our security doors."

"I suppose we should be grateful they stunned us," Caldwell said unconvincingly, "but I'm getting a very bad vibe about this."

"Me too," Sam said, making a second attempt at standing. She succeeded with help from Caldwell. "Have you taken a head count?"

"Fifty two so far, but they keep bringing in more groups every few minutes."

Sam did a full 160, staring at the contents of the cargo bay. "This is too small to be the primary storage bay."

"Assuming this ship is designed to Ancient specs, I'd agree," Caldwell said as Sam leaned on his arm for support. She'd been hit twice by the stun weapon, if her memory was correct. Once in the arm, then once in abs.

"I assume the doors are locked."

"Actually they're using a force field just inside the perimeter of the walls. We don't have access to the doors, save for those," he said, pointing to the far side of the bay.

"Why those?"

"They lead to a set of restrooms, thankfully," Caldwell said sarcastically. "I already tried finding a way out through them, but didn't have any luck."

"That's a bad sign," Carter said, finally releasing his arm. Her strength was starting to come back.

"How so?"

"It means they intend to hold us here for a while."

"You're right. I hadn't thought about that."

"Have you seen anyone you recognized besides Ronon?"

"Larrin and what looked like a group of travelers brought in the last bunch."

Sam raised her eyebrows. "Really. I thought I heard their Aurora was destroyed during the incident with the Attero device."

"That's what I thought too," Caldwell said pessimistically. "None of this is making any sense."

"Whoever it was that boarded the Odyssey came for Sheppard. He freed him before he took over the bridge."

"You think it was Stevenson?"

"Possibly," Sam admitted, "but I don't see the Traveler connection."

"How did they manage to knock us out of hyperspace anyway? I thought that was impossible."

"I don't know," Sam said, concerned. "Whoever it is knows a lot more about hyperspace than we do."

"Now there's a cheery thought," Caldwell said as one of the sets of doors into the bay opened. "Speak of the devil."

Larrin led the way through, followed by six more Earth personnel on floating sleds, all unconscious, two Traveler guards… and Teyla.

"Hey Blondie," Larrin said, looking directly at Carter. "Get over here."

Sam walked toward the edge of the blue force field as it shimmered into translucence as the guards pushed the sleds through. They pulled the unconscious crewmen off and laid them on the floor as Sam slowly walked toward the edge of the shield were Larrin was standing.

"What do you want?"

"Not me," Larrin answered tersely as she touched a small crystal on her wristband. The section of shield the guards had entered and exited through shimmered once then returned to transparency. "Her."

Larrin walked away with her guards, but Teyla remained.

"Hello Colonel Carter," she said respectfully as she approached the edge of the shield and stopped barely two feet from Sam.

"Teyla, what's going on?" she asked, almost pleading.

"I could ask you the same question."

"Why we're here in Pegasus?"

Teyla nodded.

Sam sighed, glanced at the floor, then locked eyes with the Athosian. "I won't lie to you. We came here to retake Atlantis."

Teyla locked her fingers together over the trim red clothing clinging to her body like a glove and settled them over her abdomen in a patient gesture. "So that you may fulfill your plans to destroy it?"

"No, we weren't going to destroy it," Sam said quickly. "That option has been taken off the table."

"I'm pleased to hear it," Teyla said, almost sarcastically.

Sam glanced up at the invisible shield separating them. "What are we doing here?"

"You have been placed aboard this ship for transport back to Atlantis. Your ships' hyperdrives were damaged in the battle and require repairs before they too will be brought to Atlantis. You will be arriving a day or so before them."

"And then?"

"That has not yet been decided," Teyla said stiffly.

"You're angry, aren't you?"

"Should I not be? If you had succeeded in capturing Atlantis, any hope of freeing this galaxy of the Wraith would have been destroyed."

"Even with Atlantis, we couldn't stop the Wraith," Sam argued. "Yes, we did them some damage, but we didn't have the resources to win a war against the same enemy that defeated the Ancients."

"The Wraith defeated the Lanteans, not the Alterra," Teyla corrected her. "And even if Earth is unwilling to continue the fight, it has no right to deny us the chance to free ourselves. Atlantis doesn't belong to you."

"Who does it belong to, Teyla? Be honest, who would have more use for the city, our people that understand its technology or the Athosians and others like your people who can't use, let alone understand it."

"My former people's lack of technical skills is not an excuse for Earth stealing Atlantis from us."

"Your 'former' people?"

"I am no longer Athosian," Teyla said proudly. "I am now Alterran."

"Excuse me?"

"You heard correctly. I have become one of the Ancestors of the Ancestors, those that created the Lanteans before they themselves were killed from a plague. They are the ones you call Ancients from your home galaxy."

"How?" Sam said, not believing what she was hearing.

"Stevenson has been given the power to change those whom he deems worthy into Alterra. I am the second person he has gifted with this honor, and I do not believe I will be the last."

"Wait a minute," Sam said, thinking fast. "You're saying that the Repository of Knowledge that altered Stevenson did more than upload the Ancient's knowledge into his mind… it actually transformed him into one of them?"

"Yes."

"Then he had you go through the same process?"

"No, Colonel. He transformed me himself, through nothing more than the touch of skin and mind. My transformation isn't yet complete, nor is my training, but within a few more months I will be fully Alterran, in both body and mind."

"So you see," Teyla continued when Sam was at a loss for words, "we not only have the power to fight the Wraith, we now have the power to annihilate them once and for all. This is what you have attempted to deny us, and fortunately for the Pegasus galaxy you have failed."

"You're serious," Sam said, still finding it hard to believe.

"I am. I am also dismayed that you of all people would have taken part in this."

"I have my reasons."

"I'm listening."

Sam sighed. "I guess there's not really anything I can say to get you to let us out of this cell."

"No, but I would like to hear why you turned against your friends."

"I never turned against you," she said, the words catching in your throat. "You don't understand the chain of command. When Sheppard did what he did, he made himself an enemy of Earth."

"And of you?"

"Yes and no."

Teyla shook her head. "You cannot have it both ways. You are either his enemy or his friend. You have known each other too long for there to be any other option."

"Teyla, I don't see any of you as my enemy."

"Your actions speak otherwise."

"My actions aren't of my own making. I have orders that I have to follow whether I like them or not."

"There is always a choice… just perhaps not always a pleasant one."

"You're saying I should have turned rogue like Sheppard did?"

"Why not? If your superiors are as corrupt as you imply, why then would you continue to follow them?"

Sam laughed without any trace of humor. "It's nowhere near that simple."

"Yes it is," Teyla said softly. "It is a matter of whether you make decisions for yourself, or let others make those choices for you. You have allowed the latter to take place. You claim you are only following the orders of others, but somewhere along the line you had to make the choice to ignore your own intuition, your own conscious. You gave away your freedom at that moment, but not the responsibility for your actions."

Teyla turned and walked away from the force field, leaving Sam on the other side.

"Wait… don't go."

Teyla stopped and half turned back. "You have lost your way, Samantha. If you are the person I believed you to be, then you will find your way back. If not, then we shall never speak again."

Teyla left the cargo hold, her Ancient robes fluttering slightly along her legs and arms as she walked out the doors.

Caldwell walked up to Sam and put his hand on her shoulder. "That sounded rough."

"I have a feeling that's just the tip of the ice berg," she warned him. "This far away from Earth, there's no one to rescue us."

"Which leaves us at their mercy," Caldwell said ominously. "The same people we were going to haul back to Earth for courts martial or leave behind in Pegasus at the mercy of the Wraith."

"Let's hope they don't hold too much of a grudge," Sam said, trying to get her nerve back. She was the leader here. The others needed her to stay strong.

"Sheppard's not that kind of person," Caldwell assured her.

"And Stevenson?" she asked, already knowing the answer.

Caldwell shrugged. "Your guess is as good as mine. He used to be SGC… let's hope that counts for something."

"Unless we can find a way to escape this shield, hoping is all we're going to be able to do."

"You have any ideas?" Caldwell asked, a bit more positive.

"Not yet, but I'm working on it." She turned and glanced back over the portion of her crew that was assembled in this cell. "Do an inventory check on everything in our possession. Maybe someone had something useful in their pockets when they got stunned."

"Worth a try," Caldwell said, walking quietly over to the nearest crewmen. He knew better than to announce their intentions publically, and would carry out his search person to person in as ambiguous a manner as possible.

Sam meanwhile took off her jacket and began to walk the perimeter of the shield, testing for the invisible barrier with the cloth instead of her skin. Maybe they'd overlooked a weakness when the set up the shield emitters, which she could clearly see attached to the floor on the other side, or maybe there was a loose panel in the floor or in the restrooms which Caldwell had mentioned.

Either way, it was something to do. And the last thing Sam wanted was to sit and think about how she'd totally screwed up this mission.

"Let's go," Larrin told Carter and Caldwell as she pulled them out of the confinement area at gunpoint.

"Where are we going?" Caldwell asked.

"You're getting your own private rooms in Atlantis," Larrin answered as she nudged them out through the door into the corridors that spanned the length of the Tria.

"What about the rest of our people?" Sam asked.

"They're staying put for the moment," Larrin said, stopping in the middle of the hallway. "I've gotta ask… how in the blazes did you ever think you'd have a chance of retaking Atlantis?"

"As long as we're prisoners," Sam said, ignoring her question, "we don't really have to answer questions like that, now do we."

Larrin half smiled, but it wasn't a pleasant one. "Have a look," she said, pointing inside an adjacent room with her gun. Caldwell and Carter reluctantly walked inside… and were treated with an orbital view of Hoth as the Tria descended towards the surface through the mass of ships that was only a small portion of the Traveler fleet.

"Like I said… you didn't stand a chance," Larrin scoffed, nudging Caldwell in the back as the Tria started to brush against the first wisps of atmosphere.

The two Earth officers exchanged glances, then let Larrin lead them to the Tria's ring room.

"Inside," she ordered.

Caldwell and Carter stepped inside the rings, but Larrin didn't follow. Instead she walked over to the ring controls. "Look on the bright side," she said sarcastically. "At least you're making it inside the city. Had you actually gotten this far on your own, our fleet would have turned your pathetic ships into scrap."

The rings sprang up around the pair, then quickly descended back into the floor… and Caldwell and Carter found themselves staring at Ronon inside the very ring platform they'd intended to use to board the city during the assault.

"Welcome back," the Setidan said, smiling. He motioned them forward with his standard pistol, an identical match for the weapon Larrin carried.

Caldwell looked down at the gun.

"You know I'll use it," Ronon warned.

"Yeah," Caldwell said, stepping out ahead of Sam. She followed him and Ronon out of Atlantis's ring room while two men she didn't recognize took up guard positions behind them.

Both ship captains knew better than to try to escape under Ronon's watch. Caldwell stood proud under the scrutiny of the passersby that they encountered on the way to the brig, some of whom he recognized as defectors, others were Pegasus natives like Ronon, but there were many more new faces than old, which made him feel even more concerned. Whatever was taking place in Atlantis had gone well beyond an internal Earth squabble.

Sam, meanwhile, hung her head and tried to walk as quickly as possible.

---

"Nice digs," Dr. Jackson said as he walked into the brig.

"Daniel?" Sam said in surprise. "How did you get here?"

"I live here," he said pointedly. "The question is… what are you doing here?"

Sam sighed. "Not you too."

"Me too what?"

"Sheppard already gave me an ear full," she said bashfully. "How did you get to Atlantis?"

"Oh, let's just say I was given an invitation."

"An invitation?" Sam asked skeptically.

"Yeah… then a nice, short trip via that Ancient warship you recently had a run in with, I hear."

"Tell me about it," Sam said, sitting down on the lone chair provided in her square Atlantis cell. She dipped her head, then raised it back up with a renewed energy. "I literally don't know how they did it."

"Did what?"

"Daniel, their drones passed right through our Asgard shields."

"And you didn't think they would?"

"No."

"Why not? We've seen drones pass through a ship's shields before. We know Anubis's mothership was upgraded with at least some Ancient knowledge and even its shields couldn't protect against the drones."

"But according to the Asgard data core, their shields are supposed to block the drones. I made damn sure of that before I even considered attacking the city."

"Which brings up a whole other line of conversation," Daniel said, switching subjects.

"Why I did it?"

"Why did you do it?" Daniel asked in all seriousness. "These were your friends and colleagues for over a year. The I.O.A. did them dirty and they fought back. I can't for the life of me understand why you sided against them."

"I didn't turn against them...they turned against Earth."

"They turned against the I.O.A.," Daniel countered. "That's a big difference."

"The I.O.A. is Earth. Like it or not, that's the reality of the current situation."

"Look, I know you've been away for a while, but things with the I.O.A. have been getting worse."

Sam frowned. "How so?"

"I won't bore you with the details, but let's just say their shadier side is growing in influence and isn't afraid to see the light of day. They're doing things in the open that five years ago they'd have been imprisoned for… nowadays it's just par for the course."

"Like what?" Sam pressed.

"Alright… a month before I left General Landry stumbled onto a little side project the I.O.A. had set up on a moon called Belson. It was a medical facility that they were using to conduct illicit research that was banned on Earth. Now, even though Belson had a stargate, they didn't once use it to send their people or supplies through. Instead they hid the whole affair, using the Daedalus and the Apollo to ferry cargo to and from the moon while enroute to other locations. Neither the Captains nor the crew were told the content of the cargo they were carrying, only that they had classified drop orders given to them from time to time from the SGC."

"Wait… if it came from the SGC, then Landry should have known about it."

Daniel shook its head. "The orders were forged by an I.O.A. associate assigned to the SGC. So technically the orders were coming from the facility, but they were not originating from the US military as the Daedalus and Apollo believed."

Sam made a noise under her breath. "The gall of some people. I assume either Landry or O'Neill took care of it?"

"Jack wanted to, but the President stepped in and sanctioned their activities."

"What?!"

"I know… Jack about blew a gasket. The deal was that medical facility had to abandon the forbidden research and be subjected to official oversight… by an I.O.A. representative."

"That's insane. You said they were the ones who set it up in the first place."

"Exactly. Their corruption is being sanctioned at an official level, one that people like Landry and O'Neill can't always undo. And here I find out that you're working with them."

"No," Sam said, almost out of reflex. "My orders came from O'Neill."

"Really," Daniel said, frowning. "I find that hard to believe."

"He's the one that chose me for the assignment."

Daniel shook his head slowly. "No, there's got to be more to it than that. What were his exact orders?"

Sam swallowed. "To recover Atlantis if possible."

Daniel raised an eyebrow. "If possible?"

"He said if it couldn't be done then we'd abandon the idea entirely. I thought we could pull it off, based on the information we'd been given. I never suspected the Asgard core would contain misinformation."

"Who says it did?"

"Daniel, it said the Asgards' shields protected against the drone weapons."

"Ok, but in all fairness, the Odyssey, even with all the upgrades and the ZPM it carries, is still a far cry from an actual Asgard ship."

Sam gave him a patronizing look. "They gave us the best of what they had."

"I know, they said as much, but I've been thinking about this for a long time, both during my research through the Asgard database and more recently the files the Ancients had on the Asgard, which have provided some significant insights into their civilization and culture."

"And?"

"Why did they choose to upgrade the Odyssey and not one of their own ships? If they were really giving us everything they had, and we know they had at least a few warships left after the war with the replicators, why didn't they give us those?"

Sam blinked. "I guess I never thought about it that way."

"Well I have, and I think there was a reason behind it. By giving us the blueprints for their technology, they were insuring that we'd have to gain a basic grasp of the principles of the science before we could recreate it ourselves. They knew that would take decades, if not centuries, and we'd have to advance as a civilization in order to take full advantage of what they'd given us. Upgrading the Odyssey was a way to protect their legacy and give us a means to fight the Ori… short of simply giving us their ships."

"Wait a minute," Sam interrupted. "You're saying they gave us the bike, but with the training wheels still attached?"

"Nice metaphor," he granted. "But I think you've hit it on the head. We weren't ready for everything… but they still gave us everything. And the way in which they did ensured that we had to advance before we'd be able to use it."

"So you're saying a real Asgard ship probably could have stood up to the drones," Sam said, thinking out loud.

"They are a lot bigger than ours."

Sam laughed. "Size really isn't the issue, Daniel. It's the design of the shield that counts."

"Then how did they do it?" Daniel asked, clearly waiting for an answer.

Sam shrugged.

"And, by the way, how did you think things were going to turn out going up against a real live Ancient?" Daniel said, heavily emphasizing that last bit.

Sam turned to the side, avoiding his gaze.

"Come on, Sam. I know you. What's the unseen angle in all this?"

She turned back. "Bottom line… Earth needs Atlantis. It's too valuable an asset to let go."

"Sam, the I.O.A. was going to destroy it in the first place."

"I know," she said, nodding her head. "And I'm glad it worked out so they didn't. Thankfully, we were able to get them to change their policy on that."

Daniel shook his head slowly. "I don't believe it. You're a sell out."

"A what?" Sam protested.

"You heard me. A sell out. You were the last person in the galaxy I would have expected to succumb to their corruptive influences… but somehow they got to you. Somehow they turned you."

"Daniel!"

"No," he said, taking a half step back. "Sheppard was right. You've changed. I didn't believe it when he asked me to talk to you, but now sadly I see he was right."

"What am I supposed to say to that?" Sam bit back. "You talk to me for all of two minutes then turn your back on me like I was a stranger."

"No one is turning their back on you," Daniel said calmly, but distantly. "You used to know the difference between right and wrong, and given that you're doing things that the old you would never have done, I have to assume that you no longer possess that base function. The only other alternative is that you know the difference and have intentionally chosen the side of evil… which I flat out refuse to believe."

"What? So I'm evil now?"

"You've allied yourself to it," Daniel said, crossing his arms over his chest. "The Sam I knew would have died first… or had some incredibly brilliant plan to pull the wool over the eyes of the enemy and turn them upside down at the last moment. If that's the case please elaborate."

"Well aren't you smug today."

Daniel nodded. "I thought so," he said, quietly turning around and leaving.

Sam got up out of her chair when he went, but didn't say anything. Instead she turned around and kicked the chair into the shield bars in frustration.

---

Stevenson stood in the gateroom surrounded by seventy three Earth personnel seated on the floor in neat rows while replicator guards wielding stun rifles kept watch over them. The Alterra waited silently until all of this first group were settled into their cramped formations before he spoke.

"You find yourselves captives in a war not of your own making," he began, walking slowly up the column of open floor between the stargate and steps leading up to the control room. The Earth personnel were lined up on either side of that two meter wide gap.

"You came here, thinking you were going to reclaim stolen property of Earth and capture the criminals responsible. You have been lied to… and now it is time that you heard the truth."

"I am Ryan Stevenson, formerly a member of SG-14, and before that SG-7. On a mission to explore one of the remaining uncharted stargate addresses I encountered a device called the Repository of Knowledge. Some of you know of it as a 'head sucker' because that is the term Jack O'Neill labeled it with when he encountered two similar devices. He was nearly killed both times, and only survived due to the intervention of the Asgard."

"Because of the danger involved, standing orders were given never to interact with the technology if it was ever encountered again. I violated those standing orders when I discovered a third device and used it on myself."

"I did so because I was already dying from a degenerative disease that Earth's doctors could not cure. I figured what the hell, I might as well try. If I died, at least it would be a quick death, unlike the long debilitating one I had ahead of me."

"I nearly died from using the technology, but my physiology was slightly more advanced than that of O'Neill's and I survived by the barest of margins. As some of you have been told, I now possess the knowledge of the Ancients… but that in itself is another lie."

"I have not been given a mental library of their knowledge… I have been transformed into one of the original Ancients, known as the Alterra. The Repository of Knowledge was designed to transform a sufficiently advanced human into an Alterra for the express purpose of rebuilding the Ancient civilization millions of years after it was destroyed by a plague that killed every last one of them."

"The Lanteans, that inhabited this city, were like you in the beginning. They were not Alterra, they were humans, tasked with safeguarding this city and protecting the lesser humans developing within the Pegasus galaxy. It was feared that they too might encounter the plague and be killed… but they didn't, and they weren't. The Lanteans developed physically and mentally over several million years, making them far more advanced than you, but still not the equivalent of us."

"I say 'us' because I am fully Alterra now. I know not only from history but from personal experience how advanced, and how inferior the Lanteans were. They used the knowledge and technology we left them to build their own civilization in this galaxy, one that mirrored ours, but one that also fell far short of what we once had. Meanwhile, the humans in your galaxy continued to develop, and the Repository of Knowledge continued to wait while you advanced."

"The Lanteans didn't know of the Repository's existence. None were built in Pegasus, and they had been given strict orders never to leave this galaxy, for fear of them contracting the plague that killed the Alterra. This is why Pegasus stargates do not connect with those in the rest of the gate network. The Lanteans were isolated in order to protect them… and continued to be so until they lost the war against the Wraith and the few survivors fled back to Earth as a last resort."

"Could one of them have used the Repository and become Alterran? Yes, they were physiologically advanced enough at that point to have used the technology without fear of death… but they were never meant for it, and had no knowledge of it. They lived out their lives away from the Pegasus galaxy as they chose, and what happened to most of them is still a mystery. Many, I suspect, altered the course of history on Earth and are partly responsible for it being one of the more developed human worlds in the galaxy."

"Now, we come to the present. I have used the Repository. I have survived. I have become Alterra. The plans laid down by the Ancients millions of years ago are now, finally, beginning to unfold. I have begun to rebuild our civilization, and whereas I was one Alterra, now there are three. And in coming years there will be many more."

"The Return of the Ancients has begun. Races across twenty three galaxies have been waiting for this day throughout most of their recorded history. We were their friends and allies, and when we were killed it left them defenseless and alone. Our brethren, the Asgard and the Furlings, did their best to aid them, but they were ill equipped for the task. By my count, two thirds of the races that we befriended have been wiped from existence in our absence."

"I will not let the remaining third suffer their fate. We are building as fast as we can, but a civilization that spans galaxies is not an easy thing to recreate. It will take time, and I hope that our friends can survive a little bit longer until we are able to come to their aid as we once did so long ago."

"I tell you this so that you will understand that your mission to retake Atlantis was not one of capturing criminals… you were ignorantly attempting to destroy the Alterrans for a second time before we'd barely begun to rise again."

"Fortunately, you were ill equipped for the task, and have failed miserably. To those of you assembled here, I do not hold a grudge against you. Your failure has saved you from retribution. Even an ignorant action can be deadly, but your actions proved impotent. Others among you, still held within the containment cells, knew more than you did, and I will not forgive them so easily."

"In a few moments we will open a wormhole back to Earth. You are all free to go… but you go with a warning. You now know the truth. If you decide to move against us again, then you are knowingly becoming our enemy, and you will be treated accordingly."

"However, if any among you wish to stay and help us rebuild, I offer you that chance here and now. You will be welcome here, as will your skills, limited as they may be."

Stevenson ended his speech on that note and climbed the stairs into the control room.

"Dial Avalon," he told Corporal Fulton, who was manning the control room that shift.

When the wormhole opened Stevenson activated the visual communications link. "Stargate Command, this is Atlantis. I need to speak to General Landry immediately."

The voice of the control room Sergeant came back on audio only. "Ah, may I ask who you are?"

Stevenson raised an eyebrow. "Nice to see you too, Sparky."

"Ryan?" Walter asked, activating their half of the visual communications link.

"Who else?"

"Actually, we weren't expecting to hear from you… "

"I know, you were expecting to hear from General Carter saying that she'd recaptured Atlantis."

"Ah, well… I… "

"Relax, Sparky. I'm not upset with you, but I do need to talk to Landry."

"He's on his way now."

"He's here now," Landry's voice said a moment before he walked into the picture.

"General… " Stevenson said evenly.

"You'll forgive me if I don't look happy to see you."

"I need you to lower the iris."

"Really?" Landry said, smiling. "Now why would we do that?"

"So I can return your people to you," Stevenson said, not caring for his tone. "Several groups over the next few hours."

All levity drained from Landry's face. "What happened?"

"They lost," Stevenson said simply. "We took them alive, if that's any conciliation, and I don't intend on holding them here indefinitely. So if you don't mind… "

"Look here son, you know I can't just lower the iris based on your word. Not even if you trotted General Carter out and had her tell us herself."

"General, I'm asking nicely. If I have to take down your iris myself, it will be in such a way that you'll have to buy a new one afterwards… and I know how much the Air Force hates to throw good money away."

"You know I don't take well to threats," Landry warned.

"Is that a no?"

"That's a no," the General said defiantly. "However, if you really do have our people then we need to discuss… "

Stevenson didn't bother to listen to what he said next as he walked out of the control room and down to the stargate. He stood in front of the open wormhole and mentally linked to the gate. He could see the inside of stargate command as well as the exact position of the iris. He knew that in its current position matter wouldn't materialize and even the disruptive vortex couldn't manifest… but if it moved even a fraction of a millimeter distant."

Stevenson raised his left hand, palm up toward the event horizon and released a golden stream of energy into it. Through his mental link he monitored the status of the iris, which didn't move, but the inside layer of it had became less rigid, even molten in the tiny center of the baseball-sized impact point.

He let loose a slightly larger stream of destructive energy in the exact same spot and succeeded in making the opposite side glow, which threw the SGC personnel into a tizzy, but he had accomplished his goal. The point of impact from his attack had lost the thin layer of molecules of that spot. They'd been melted away into a nearly imperceptible wrinkle on the back side of the iris, but with the gate's intricate sensors he could see that he'd made just enough of a crack.

Stevenson lowered his hand and mentally ordered the gate on the terminating side to pulse its vortex. When it did, only the smallest part of it formed within that crack, which ate away a little more of the dense material that made up the iris.

Then it pulsed again, and again, and again. Each time more material was stripped away from the back side of the iris, and as the crack enlarged, more and more of the vortex was able to manifest itself.

After dozens of pulses a small hole the size of a golf ball came into view from Landry's side of the iris. The next pulse extended ten feet out through that hole and enlarged it, eating away laterally at the iris material.

"Son of a bitch," Landry said, not believing his eyes.

"General?" Walter asked.

"Security teams to the gateroom," Landry ordered.

---

After hundreds of pulses Stevenson finally had the iris destroyed, save for a small ring around the outside that would trip anyone coming through the gate that the vortex couldn't reach without risk of splashing up against the side walls of the gate.

Stevenson stopped the pulses and instead ordered the Pegasus gate to descend a foot further into the floor. The hydraulics beneath the massive ring lowered it slowly while the floor panels adjusted themselves around its new position.

The Alterran turned around and addressed the captives one last time. "The time to choose has come. Those wishing to return to Earth may do so now. The iris is no longer blocking the gate, but mind the bump as you step through. The other side is a bit lower now, so you'll have to step down when you come through. Bend at the knees when you go through or make a tiny hop through the event horizon and you shouldn't fall, but just in case you do we'll send you through one at a time."

"Guards, leave us and return with the second group."

The replicators moved as one and walked off into the city as the Earth personnel began to stand.

"Form a line here. I can see what happens on the other side, so if you fall I'll know to give you a few seconds to pick yourself up."

Captain Norris was the first to step into line, with most of those assembled organizing themselves behind her… but at least a dozen walked off to the corners of the room, making their intent to stay clear. Some of the Earth-bound personnel gave them dirty looks, but their fortitude didn't give out and they held their ground.

"Go," Stevenson told Norris, who opted to bend low while moving into the gate.

On the other side Stevenson saw the Captain stumble more from the guns pointed at her than the drop. He saw Landry order them to stand down and the Captain walk down the ramp.

"Next," he said patiently.

---

After all the groups had gone through the gate, Sheppard brought Caldwell, Ellis, Woolsey, and Carter down by themselves. They were the last four members of the botched expedition for Stevenson to deal with… but with them being the willing instigators his chat with them was going to be of a different nature.

"Before we begin," Stevenson said, crossing his arms over his chest in front of the still open gate. He still had 17 minutes left on this wormhole before the auto-close function would activate, and he didn't think this conversation would take that long. "All of your people have been sent back to Earth through the stargate or they've chosen to remain here in Atlantis."

"Chosen?" Woolsey asked, not believing it. "Why would they do that?"

"Some of them are pretty smart," Sheppard chimed in. "Present company not included."

"I don't think… " Woolsey began before Stevenson took away his ability to talk.

"Listen," he said quietly, looking at all four people before releasing his hold on Woolsey's vocal chords. "What you came here to do was not in the spirit of the stargate program that I signed up for. We were supposed to be explorers and defenders of Earth, making contact with other worlds and forming alliances with those we found that we could call friend."

"What you came here to do went well beyond that. It involved revenge, greed, arrogance, and above all else corruption. The I.O.A.," he said, looking directly at Woolsey, "is detrimental to Earth's future, both with regards to internal operations and your relationships with other worlds. They've proven to be cheats, liars, cowards, and two-faced backstabbers that no offworld representative in their right mind could ever come to trust. They will continue to corrupt the SGC and isolate Earth from potential allies and trading partners."

"As for the corruption part, you three are prime examples. They've got you doing their dirty work for them. You are Air Force officers… Colonels all. A certain level of moral fortitude is expected of all officers, but the leadership responsibilities that go along with being a Colonel require you to know when to follow orders and when to refuse them."

"The longer the I.O.A. has its tendrils into the stargate program, the more difficult it will be to refuse immoral orders without throwing your entire career away. They are using intimidation to encourage good people to keep their mouth shut when they would normally protest. When that happens, the corruption of the program begins to snowball until it becomes so embedded that it cannot be removed… or until someone comes in from the outside and cuts it out forcefully."

"I didn't expect this from the three of you," Stevenson said, looking at each captain in turn. Then he looked at Woolsey. "Such things are usually reserved for scum like him that hide their evil beneath a fa… ade of weak civility, only to show their true colors when they believe themselves to be in a position of power."

"On your ships you are the power," Stevenson reminded them. "If you are given orders to the contrary, to let someone like him command you, you should refuse the assignment, as you should have refused this one. That error in judgment has cost you your ships, which we will be putting to more productive use."

"As for you," Stevenson said, his voice growing darker. "I had a chat with McKay before he went back to Earth. He told me you were supposed to abandon the mission after a year. Why didn't you?"

Sam ground her teeth, mentally cursing Rodney. "The mission wasn't complete."

Stevenson nodded. "The difference between you and them," he said, pointing at Caldwell and Ellis, "is that you chose this mission. They were assigned to it. You should have returned to Earth as your orders allowed when your deployment time expired. You chose to continue, which makes you as culpable as them," he said, pointing at Woolsey.

Stevenson lowered his eyes to the floor and closed them in disgust. "Go."

After a few exchanged looks, the foursome walked past Stevenson towards the still open gate.

"What was that?" Stevenson asked angrily, turning about and grabbing Woolsey in a telekinetic hold.

"I didn't say anyt… ," he said as he was lifted a foot off the floor.

"No, don't hide it," Stevenson said, searching his mind. "Something about me."

Woolsey didn't, or couldn't, say anything.

"You really thought you could pull that off," Stevenson said. "That wouldn't have worked either."

Sheppard frowned, still standing on the steps. Whatever Woolsey was saying to him must have been within his mind.

"That's not the first time you've proposed that, is it?" Stevenson said, visibly constricting Woolsey's neck. "And what did you plan to do when I broke free?"

Woolsey's mind connected to another train of thought in response to that question and Stevenson quickly followed that thread into others like it, exposing a web of memories Woolsey was doing his best to hide from him.

Stevenson's eyes narrowed sharply, and from where Sam was standing it was obvious that he was furious.

The next sound anyone heard was the snap of Woolsey's neck.

"What the… " Sheppard began to say before he suddenly lost his voice… and his ability to move.

Stevenson threw Woolsey's dead body back through the gate then turned and telekinetically picked up Carter. He pulled her up off the ground a few inches and brought her up in front of him.

"Did you know?" he asked, searching her mind.

She didn't.

Suddenly Sam's mind was flooded with memories Stevenson had taken from Woolsey. They were so loud, so vivid that she couldn't block them out. For the next few moments all she could see and hear was what Woolsey had seen and heard and said. She could also feel his emotions and sense his thoughts in those brief snippets of memory.

Her stomach turned upside down in the process, made even worse by the point by point explanation from Stevenson on every misstep she had made. He even went so far as to forcefully tear away the mental blocks and rationalizations she'd been using to combat her own conscious in order to find some level of symbiosis with Earth's leadership… and in doing so exposed Carter to the full emotional effect of what she had done, and what Woolsey and the I.O.A. had planned to do.

It was too much for her to handle, but she couldn't stop it. What felt like an hour of torture took place in only ten seconds, at the end of which Sam's eyes were swollen and gushing with tears.

Stevenson pulled her within a few inches of his face. "I expected more of you."

With those five words hanging in the air and echoing in Sam's mind, Stevenson threw her backwards through the stargate to what would undoubtedly be a very hard landing on the other side.

Stevenson pulled a quick check on the minds of the other two Colonels, but they knew even less than Carter had.

"Mark my words," he said, releasing the pair from his telekinetic hold. "The I.O.A. has just declared war on the Alterra… and so long as you serve them you are on the wrong side in this fight. They are the enemy of Earth, not us."

Stevenson pointed his thumb towards the gate.

Caldwell and Ellis took the cue and walked towards the open wormhole.

"One last thing," Stevenson said, stopping both of them just before they reached the event horizon. "If anyone serving the I.O.A. enters this galaxy again… you'll find us considerably less hospitable."

"We'll deliver the message," Caldwell said stiffly before walking through the gate.

Ellis hesitated. "For whatever it's worth… I'm sorry."

He followed Caldwell through the gate, then Stevenson mentally commanded it to shut down and return to its normal height. When he did, he also released his hold on Sheppard.

"What the hell was that?" Sheppard asked angrily.

Stevenson turned and looked him in the eye. He didn't say anything, but he did mentally transmit the memories he'd taken from Woolsey into the Colonel's mind.

Sheppard's eyes narrowed. "I should have shot the bastard a long time ago."

"Feel up to a field trip?" Stevenson asked.

Sheppard tilted his head in sudden comprehension. "You going after the Repository?"

Stevenson nodded.

"I'm in," Sheppard said without hesitation.

"We'll need to grab a jumper," Stevenson said, walking off with Sheppard.
