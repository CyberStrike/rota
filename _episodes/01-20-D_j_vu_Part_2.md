"There," Teal'c said quietly, pointing towards some brush.

Mitchell frowned. "You sure?"

"I am," he said with certainty.

"Alright," Cam whispered in the dead of night, "The three amigas stay here, you and I will check it out," he said, glancing back at Carter.

She nodded and turned back to look at the other two women. "Tri-point around the gate," she ordered, referring to a defensive formation. "Keep it loose."

"Got it," Vala echoed, moving off about twenty meters to the north of the gate. Carter took southwest and Jennifer Hailey took southeast as Mitchell and Teal'c followed the invisible trail off toward the northwest with the Jaffa in the lead.

Cam held up a hand as Teal'c moved a branch to his left and let it snap back. The Colonel caught it and moved on in a crouch beneath some overhanging vines. The entire planet was covered in dense foliage with an oppressive atmosphere that made the whole area feel like one giant greenhouse. Even in the moonlit night the moisture in the hot air was suffocating. Cam didn't want to be around when the sun came up… whenever that would be.

Teal'c stopped and knelt with an upraised fist that unraveled into a pointed finger that tilted toward the ground.

"I see it," Cam said, noticing the subtle boot print. "Good eyes."

"The trail is haphazard," Teal'c noted, "they haven't come this way before."

Cam lifted his head and looked around, not really seeing anything beyond a couple of meters in the wisps of moonlight breaking through the short canopy. "Plan B?"

"It would seem so," Teal'c agreed.

"How far you guess?"

Teal'c grunted and walked forward.

"Is that far or close?" he asked, still a whisper.

"Close," Teal'c confirmed as he turned to the left and pulled back a lock of vines. On the ground was a wad of prints and several cigarette butts.

"Hmmn," Cam mumbled. "Interesting."

"Indeed," Teal'c said as he pointed further off to the left. "It appears they doubled back."

"How many?"

"At least three."

"Go," Mitchell said, fingering his radio's call button. "Heads up. These guys may be closer than we thought."

"Copy that," Carter's voice came back. "No activity here."

"Roger," Cam said, following a couple of steps behind Teal'c.

A few minutes later Teal'c stopped them again, this time with his staff weapon raised… but as soon as he pointed the tip forward he lowered it back down.

"What?"

"Hailey," Teal'c answered, standing up and pushing his way through more brush and vines.

"They came all the way back," Mitchell said aloud, catching the freshly minted Major's attention.

"No joy?" Hailey asked from afar.

"Looks like a wild goose hunt to me," he said as they met up in a small clearing beneath a gnarly tree. "They probably hid out here for a while then dialed another address," he said, getting on his radio. "Pull back to the gate," he ordered.

The three waded through the underbrush back towards the obscured gate as the other two members of SG-1 did likewise and became visible through the break in vegetation around the gate… but Teal'c soon broke off from the group.

"Find anything?" Carter asked.

"Trail doubled back," he told her. "Feel like digging through the DHD again?"

She winced. "Not really."

"There's gotta be some way to find the last address dialed," Cam argued.

"The new software can get us within ten, but we're still going to have to check them all out, but there's no way for me to tell which is which."

"The Ori knew a way," Cam noted.

"Colonel Mitchell!" Teal'c's voice boomed from the other side of the gate and out of sight.

Cam turned around. "Where is he?"

"Over there," Vala said, leading the way.

Not far off, but through a maze of plants, roots, and soggy holes they found Teal'c kneeling over a small clearing the size of a couple of phone booths.

"What did you find?" Cam asked.

Teal'c rapped a knuckle on something hard.

"Rings," Carter guessed in the dim light.

"Indeed," Teal'c confirmed.

"So the Chinese didn't leave the planet?" Vala said aloud what everyone else was thinking.

"There has to be an activation button," Hailey said.

Carter nodded. "She's right. If they fled Osser in a hurry they wouldn't have had time to grab a remote. There's gotta be something around here for them to use."

"Fan out," Mitchell ordered, activating his flashlight. The rest of SG-1 did likewise, no longer worried about being spotted. Wherever this set of rings led was probably far off or underground, either of which would be out of sight.

"Jack," Landry said, stepping out of his office. "The President is on the phone."

O'Neill checked his watch. He technically still had three minutes till deadline, but triggering the lockdown had washed that formality away. "Not interested."

Landry nodded. "I told him you'd assumed command and taken me out of the loop."

"Anyone else call yet?"

"Three automatic responses from the CIA, NID, and Homeworld Security. I've got another from the FBI on hold until I finish with the President. I promised to personally tell you you're in direct violation of a Presidential Order and relieve you of command."

"Funny… I don't feel relieved."

"Just going through the motions… plausible deniability and all."

"Yes, plause all you need to. If this goes south I don't want it landing on anyone besides me," Jack said in earnest.

Landry nodded. "Attempt to relieve you of command failed. I'll inform the President."

"Send him my worst," O'Neill joked as a pair of Colonels jogged up the stairwell into the briefing room where Jack sat alone at the long table. He raised his eyebrows at them.

"Lockdown is confirmed," Colonel Herreson said a little out of breath. "All entrances have guards posted in case they try and force their way in."

"All secondary personnel have been confined to quarters," Larson added. "They're not very happy about it, but they're staying put voluntarily. I've got guards posted in case we need to lock them in."

Jack nodded. "Any holdouts?"

Larson half smiled. "None, sir."

"Put additional guards on the beaming jammers. If those are sabotaged then the 304s can pull us out at will… and if they do manage to infiltrate the base that'll be one of their top priorities."

"Sir," Herreson asked, "are there any other alien transportation devices on base?"

"Good question," Jack said, glancing at Larson who shrugged in response. "Walter!" Jack yelled.

A few moments later the gate technician scurried up the stairwell in a hustle. "Yes, sir?" he said nervously.

"Breathe first, Chief."

"Yes, sir. Thank you, sir," Walter said heaving more from agitation than exertion. The lockdown had put many people in the SGC on edge. Alien incursion was one thing, but turning against their own President was something new entirely.

"Now… " O'Neill said slowly. "Do we have any alien gizmos lying around that will allow someone to access the SGC from the outside? Any rings or something like that?"

Walter thought hard for ten seconds. "I don't think so, sir. All of that sort of thing usually goes to Area 51."

Jack nodded. "Check on it anyway, will ya?"

"Of course, sir," he said, waiting.

"Dismissed," O'Neill belatedly added.

"Yes, sir," Walter said, hurrying off.

Jack exchanged glances with the two Colonels. "Everybody else like that?"

"A lot of the civilians are," Herreson admitted.

"Not the SG teams," Larson said solidly. "They're committed."

"Keep me posted," O'Neill said, nodding. "If anyone so much as sneezes I want to know."

"Yes, sir," the Colonels said together before heading back down the stairs. Once they were gone Jack could faintly hear Landry's voice on the phone with someone other than the President, based on the tone of his voice.

Jack leaned back in his seat and twiddled his thumbs a few times in obvious protest to the waiting… he preferred taking direct action, and no matter how much the desk job had tried to suck the life out of him it'd failed to change his basic nature.

Senator Jefferson was reclining in an oversized chair in the club lobby, relishing his recent victory on the golf course as he sipped brandy with the two other congressmen and a lawyer that hadn't faired so well on their outing when an aid approached him with a phone in hand.

Jefferson frowned. "Tell me it's not Jenkins again?"

"No, sir. He says he's an old acquaintance of yours… a George Hammond. He says it's a matter of national security."

The elderly Senator's face hardened. "If you'll excuse me," he told the other members of his party as he stood up and took the phone, "I need to take this in private."

Congressman Rawlings waved him off casually until the name got past the brandy. "Did you say Hammond?"

"I'll let you know," Jefferson said quietly as he walked off. The other congressman and lawyer were oblivious to the name and were committed to not letting the interruption spoil their moment of relaxation.

Jefferson walked over to one of the golf club's panoramic windows in what was an empty section of the enormous lounge. "Jefferson," he said into the phone.

"Senator," Hammond's voice said calmly but urgently across the communications network. "We have a situation."

"I thought you'd retired, General?"

"I am, but a situation has come to my attention that I can't overlook. Jack O'Neill just received an order from the President to move the stargate outside the United States."

"What?!" Jefferson asked, not believing he'd heard right.

"I spoke with him just a few minutes ago. The President threatened him with court martial if he didn't have the gate transferred via beaming technology inside of the hour. You should know that O'Neill intends to disobey that order."

"Are you sure the order came from the President and not just in the President's name?" Jefferson asked, his mind racing through possible scenarios.

"He told me he receiving the order from the President, in person, inside the White House."

"Dear god," was all Jefferson could say.

"I promised O'Neill I'd get the word out while he buys time," Hammond added.

"Good work," Jefferson said, composing his mind into a course of action. "We won't let the President get away with this. I'll call for an emergency meeting of the Senate… at least those with clearance anyway," he added, almost as an afterthought.

"I'll leave you to it then," Hammond said. "I've got some more calls to make."

"Thank you for the tip, General. God… it looks like O'Neill may have saved our asses again. That man must have balls of steel."

"He does," Hammond agreed, "but right now he's on the wrong side of the chain of command."

"I understand," Jefferson said, nodding even though Hammond couldn't see. "I owe you one, General," he said hanging up. He walked back to the lounge chairs in a hurry.

"We have to go, now!" he told Rawlings.

"What's wrong?" Congressman Reynolds asked, half drunk.

"Nothing you need to worry about," Jefferson assured him as he pulled Rawlings away by the elbow.

"Aliens?" Rawlings whispered.

"Worse," Jefferson told him as they headed for the door with his aid following a step behind. "We have to call an emergency session now."

"Now now?" Rawlings asked. "As in tonight?"

"Within the hour," Jefferson told him as a car was pulling up in front for them, no doubt summoned by the astute aid.

Rawlings pulled his arm free of Jefferson's grasp. "You can't get them there that fast."

"No choice," Jefferson said, climbing in the back ahead of Rawlings. He waited until the door closed before adding, "We'll have the 304s beam them in from wherever they are."

"Tell me what's happened," Rawlings demanded as the car began to drive away in a hurry with the aid giving directions from the front seat. The back compartment was sealed so no breach of security was an issue with the driver.

"The President tried to move the stargate out of the country, but O'Neill balked."

Rawlings' face soured. "He can't do that without our approval."

"He just tried," Jefferson reaffirmed, "and if we don't hurry he might still succeed."

Rawlings just looked at the Senator with a blank face for a few seconds, then suddenly pulled out his own cell phone. He dialed a preset number and waited for a connection.

"Rawlings, code 327," he told the person on the other end of the secure line. "Put me through to whoever's in command at Homeworld Security. I need to arrange some immediate
transport for members of Congress."

Four hours into the lockdown the surface hatch of one of the emergency exit shafts was forcibly opened and two canisters of tear gas were dropped over the edge. The clanked against the walls and ladder until they hit bottom and rattled around for half a second before spewing out an ever thickening cloud of poisonous gas.

Through that gas a long line of black clad, mask wearing special ops teams climbed down the ladder as far as they could until they were backed up in the shaft waiting for the bottom man to burn his way through the hinges of the locked hatch and gain access to the SGC through the 'back door' rather than trying to cut their way through the foot-thick main door on the surface.

After thirty seconds of work the hinges melted through and the door popped ajar. The first man in position kicked open the heavy door halfway before it stuck in place. The gas poured out like a thick mist ahead of the trooper as he edged his way through the gap and into the corridor.

He couldn't see past the cloud until he'd taken three steps and moved into less foggy air… where he caught an intar round in the chest.

It didn't fully penetrate his flak jacket, but the combination of four more tiny energy blasts soaked enough energy through to render him unconscious before he could fire a shot. His finger, however, managed to depress as he fell and peppered the wall with a cascade of ricocheting bullets, one of which hit the man in the left calf before the butt of the gun hit the ground and bounced clear of his hand.

The sound of gunfire, both energy and projectile, prompted the assault team to double time it out of the gap and return fire… but since they had to move out in single file they made perfect targets for the pair of SG teams stationed at either side of the entrance. They'd made a hasty pull back when the gas began pouring out, but had retaken defensive positions further down the hallway lying prone on their chests, aiming upward into the cloud.

The teams alternated constant fire as they changed clips one at a time off sequence so as to not allow the invaders a chance to gain a foothold. Most of the assault team didn't make it outside the cloud, which was continuing to spread out and giving the SG teams some trouble, but the canisters had already depleted themselves and what was in the air was already thinning out considerably.

SG-12 and SG-17 kept up the fire of their stun rounds until the cloud dissipated enough that they could see their fellow teams through a gap in the stack of black clothed bodies cluttering the surface exit. Having kept low to the ground, all friendly fire had traveled through the cloud at knee to chest height and impacted on the ceiling above the opposing team, keeping them safe from each other's cross fire and keeping them below the few bullets that the special ops teams had blindly returned fire with.

Both teams rose to a knee stand while SG-12 sent one man ahead to check out the entrance. He stepped over several bodies before tucking his gun around the corner and spraying a few shots into the shaft, exposing nothing more than his weapon and hand. He pulled the fake P-90 back across his chest… listened… then took a quick glance around the corner.

He took a second peek, then stepped over the back of a downed man and inspected the bottom of the shaft. No one was present… stunned or otherwise. All that remained were the two empty gas canisters.

Not wanting to expose himself by looking up the shaft, the man wrenched the door shut, but with the hinges cut it wouldn't go back all the way. Only the lock held it in place, but it was clearly off center and not matching up to the opening in the wall.

"Get a welding team up here," Colonel Mathison ordered. "And some barricades. They might try again."

One of his team members nodded and got on his radio.

"They were firing live rounds," Colonel Frankfort reminded him.

"Yeah… considerate of them, wasn't it."

Frankfort hefted his intar. "And we've got these?"

"Worked well enough," Mathison argued. "And we don't have to hesitate."

Frankfort snorted. "I didn't see them hesitate either."

"No… they didn't," SG-17's leader said, the worry evident in his voice.

"We're supposed to be on the same side," Frankfort argued, gesturing to the unconscious men beneath their feet that the other team members were disarming and dragging off to the side.

Mathison noticed one of the downed men's hand flexing. He pointed his intar at the man's forehead and delivered another shot. "Somebody doesn't think so."

Frankfort shook his head. "I don't like where this is heading."

"Neither do I, but we're not the ones using live rounds."

"I can't believe the President ordered this. Someone else must be pulling the strings."

"Doesn't matter. We've got a job to do either way."

Frankfort nodded once. "Brig?"

"Radio for another team to come get them. We can't let our guard down. These guys seem to want in here pretty bad… and right now the door won't shut."

"You calling it in?"

"We might not be the only one?" Mathison echoed his fellow Colonel's thoughts as he grabbed his radio's call button. "Mathison to General O'Neill."

"O'Neill… what do ya got?"

"Assault team came down number four shaft. We stopped them, no casualties… but they were firing live rounds. One of their own men took a hit in the leg."

"Get him down to the infirmary under guard. Once they patch him up transfer him to a holding cell."

"Any other activity, sir?"

"Shaft two got hit five minutes ago," O'Neill told him. "Lieutenant Rathbone took one in the arm, but SG-7 and 18 kept them out."

"Good to know, sir. We'll continue to keep them out here, but we could use a couple barricades if they come back again in larger numbers."

"Way ahead of you," O'Neill informed him. "Equipment is already on the way. Couple one way shield generators too."

"That'd be useful if we're going to be dodging bullets."

"Yeah..." O'Neill said oddly.

"Not your fault, sir," Mathison said firmly. "We didn't draw first blood. They did."

"Never said it was," O'Neill smarted back, "… but thanks."

"You do what you need to, General… we've got your back all the way."

"Probably better seal that shaft permanently," Jack suggested.

"Already have a welding team enroute," Mathison assured him.

---

"Good," O'Neill said from the briefing room on one of six radios lying out on the table, "by the way, did they use gas?"

"That's an affirmative," Colonel Mathison's voice answered back.

"Your team alright?" Jack asked.

"Couple blurry eyes, but that's the worst of it. We managed to pull back in time."

"There's some gas masks in the equipment package coming up, along with a medic. Have your men checked out just in case."

"Yes, sir. Thank you, sir."

"Anything else to add?"

"No, sir. That just about covers it."

"Good work up there, Colonel. O'Neill out," he finished, putting the radio back on the table before slamming his fist down alongside it.

"Jack… " Landry said quietly from behind him. O'Neill hadn't noticed he'd come out of his office.

"What?"

"We've lost all communications with the outside."

O'Neill looked up at him. "Everything?"

Landry nodded. "I was on the phone with General Neville when the lines were cut. I had Siler check, and it looks like they cut the hard lines at the surface as well as jammed the mobile signals."

"What did the General have to say?" Jack said, not dwelling on the worsening situation.

"He said you were out of line, but he was livid when I told him about the assault. I think he was coming over to our side when we were cut off."

"Now we can't get the word out," Jack said, running his hands through his hair in frustration.

"You can look at it this way," Landry said, sitting down in a chair next to him. "If they're cutting off communications, we must have started to get through to somebody. The fact that they assaulted the SGC no less than four hours after lockdown suggests they're in a hurry. If we can hold them off a while longer the President's political enemies may eat him alive."

"But we have no way of knowing what's going on out there?"

"No...we don't. We don't even have the surface surveillance cameras anymore. We're totally blind."

"Well," Jack said sarcastically as he stood up, "if I'm going to end up being General Custer, the least I can do is dress the part," he said, referring to the civilian clothes he was still wearing.

"If I may?" Landry asked.

"May what?"

"You look like you could use some sleep," Landry said gently.

"Yeah, well now's not the time."

"This could drag on a long time, Jack. I'll look after things for a few hours while you grab a cat nap."

Jack looked off to the side in thought, then turned back with a lowered head.

"When's the last time you slept?" Hank asked.

"Before I went to Dakara," O'Neill admitted.

"Geez, Jack. You've got to be running on empty by now."

"Coffee, actually," O'Neill corrected him. "Two hours… and I'll keep a radio on me."

"Make it three," Landry insisted.

"Two," O'Neill ordered. "Wake me if I oversleep."

"Two," Landry agreed, walking back to his office. "Maybe then you'll be clear headed enough to realize you need more sleep."

"Funny," O'Neill said to his back as he walked back into his office where his once active phone was now dead to the outside world. Jack turned to the stairwell and headed down to his semi-permanent quarters on base where he kept several spare uniforms and other odds and ends for use on his trips out from Washington.

He put the radio he'd taken from the briefing room on his lamp stand and put it on the 'all channel' feature so he'd hear anything and everything that was going on in the facility. Right now the channels were clear, but he kept the volume up high just in case he nodded off further than he planned.

Jack pulled off his jacket and sneakers and laid down on his bed, thinking he'd stay awake and mentally run through his next move, but as soon as his head hit the pillow the mounting fatigue surged past the adrenaline and pulled his eyelids down almost against his will. Thirty seconds later and he was sound asleep.

---

"Found it," Vala announced, pointing her gun-mounted flashlight at a small metal box set at the base of one of the tree trunks. On top of it was what looked like a foot pad… and it was a mere three steps away from the 'front' of the rings.

"Now what?" Carter asked.

"We take a look," Mitchell told her.

Sam raised her eyebrows. "We have no idea what we'd be walking into."

Mitchell looked at her softly. "I'm open to ideas."

"I will go," Teal'c declared.

"You're just a bigger target," Hailey argued.

Teal'c raised an eyebrow in the dim moonlight but didn't say anything. Instead he pulled off his pack and retrieved a small armband from the main pouch.

"How long have you had that?" Mitchell asked.

"A while," the Jaffa answered.

"Is that a Sodan cloaking device?" Vala asked.

"It is," Teal'c answered.

"What about the radiation?" Carter argued.

"I am Jaffa."

"Your Tretonin?" Vala guessed.

"Indeed," Teal'c said as he slipped on the forearm gauntlet.

"I'm not sure it works that way Teal'c," Carter warned.

"I will be fine," he assured her.

"Do you know that for a fact," Carter asked, "or are you just guessing?"

"It is not the first time," Teal'c told her.

"Doesn't mean there aren't long term effects."

"I will be fine," Teal'c reiterated.

"Alright," Mitchell decided. "Ring in, look around for a few seconds, then we'll ring you back out. If it's clear we'll all go in."

"Why not just radio if it's clear?" Hailey asked.

"We don't know where it will go," Carter told her. "Could be the other side of the planet."

"Right," Hailey said, mentally kicking herself for asking such a stupid question.

Teal'c walked into the center of the rings and activated his cloak. "I am ready," his voice said from nowhere.

Vala stepped on the button and five seconds later the rings exposed themselves from the ground niche and transported the invisible Teal'c somewhere.

"Not up," Vala commented at the lack of visual streak that appeared when two rings connected. It wasn't much, but in the nighttime it would have stood out in stark contrast to the dark vegetation.

"Subterranean?" Hailey offered.

Carter nodded. "Probably… or lateral transition across the horizon."

"Due to the curvature of the planet's surface," the younger Captain added.

"Well, that's probably long enough," Vala said aloud before stepping on the button again.

The rings returned and deposited nothing back into the forest. A moment later Teal'c became visible again. "Come… it is clear, but I know not how long that will remain the case."

The three members of SG-1 all clustered inside the rings around Teal'c while Vala remained over the button. "Ready?"

"Do it," Mitchell ordered.

Vala stepped on the button then darted over to the small hole they'd left for her in the formation. It was a tight fit, but Vala's petite form didn't take up very much space. A second later the rings activated for a third time and whisked them all away.

The rings deposited SG-1 at the end of a long, deserted Earth-style hallway. There were no doors or connecting shafts for ten meters or so… just a long kill zone had anyone been waiting for them. Fortunately there wasn't.

"Teal'c," Mitchell said behind the butt of his P-90.

The Jaffa stepped forward and disappeared from view beneath his Sodan cloak and went forward to scout the area.

Cam gave him a silent three count then cautiously proceeded down the squarish hallway up to the nearest door. He gently pulled down on the handle but found it firmly locked. There was no window in the door, just a small swipe card lock next to where the bolt would be.

The Colonel nodded ahead and the four visible members of SG-1 continued their slow, methodical steps trying to stay as silent as possible. The corridors were dead quiet, making even the slightest boot strikes echo loudly. Cam and the others were heel/toeing it awkwardly to try and eliminate that sound both to avoid detection and to keep their own hearing clear so they could detect others within the facility… or whatever it was.

Somehow Teal'c wasn't making a sound… whether it was the Jaffa's skill or some function of the Sodan cloak Mitchell wasn't sure, but right now Teal'c was a ghost.

Probably the cloak, he mentally concluded.

A narrow arch marked the junction with another corridor branching off to the right. Teal'c hadn't signaled them so Cam assumed it was clear and poked his head around briefly to confirm that fact.

Clear… long and clear, actually. The corridor stretched an unbelievably long way until it seemed to end in some heavy doors… or concrete wall. Mitchell wasn't sure which. He glanced back and forth between the two options, finally deciding not to turn. He waved the others forward.

"Ow!" Vala said when she suddenly ran into a force shield.

"What the hell?" Mitchell said as Hailey ran the tip of her P-90 across the invisible barrier separating them from Sam and Cam. It sparkled orange on touch, then vanished when she lowered her weapon.

"Oh, that's not good," Sam commented.

Suddenly the silence was broken by an ominous hissing sound.

"Get back to the rings," Cam told them quickly.

Vala hesitated but Hailey ran backwards the moment he issued the order.

"Go… " Mitchell yelled, prompting her to move as well. She looked ahead at the rings, wondering if there was even an activation button when Haley reached the end of the hall and bounced off another shield that was blocking them from their exit.

"No good," Vala called back. "Maybe you can get out another way."

"Carter!" Mitchell ordered, pointing down the side hallway. He was already starting to feel faint as he slowly ran off the other way. His vision started to blur as he heard another shield impact and a high pitched grunt that he assumed was Carter.

The next thing he knew his knees buckled and he slumped against the wall. A few seconds later he blacked out.

---

"Sheppard," McKay said, surprised as he passed him in the hallway.

"Rodney," John said with a nod as he walked by.

"Haven't seen you for a while," McKay commented.

Sheppard stopped a couple feet past Rodney and turned around to face him. "Busy, busy," he replied.

"Yes, who isn't these days? Where are you off to?"

"Primary chair room," John said, seeming to be in a hurry.

"Primary?"

"We added three more," he said, half turning to leave.

"Wait a minute… what are you going there for?" he said quickly as the now snobby Alterran began to drift back down the hallway.

"It's time," John said, turning away and walking on.

"Time? Time for what?" McKay yelled after him.

"To return home."

"Home?!" McKay burst out and chased after him.

---

Seven minutes later Rodney stood in the doorway to the chair room as Sheppard slid into the blue/white seat. It lit up upon physical contact with his Ancient physiology and he leaned back comfortably.

"Are we sure about this?" Rodney asked.

"All part of the plan," John said, materializing a large hologram of the desert above the chair for Rodney's sake. Mentally he activated the city-wide intercom. "Attention citizens of Atlantis… and Asgard guests. In a few moments the city will be lifting off from the surface. Don't be alarmed if you start to see stars out the windows instead of sand. However, I recommend that everyone stay inside the city walls and not on the surface. The atmosphere will remain steady within the shield, but I'd feel better if you guys weren't hitting golf balls off the balcony while we're in transit. Other than that and the stargate being offline, normal operations will continue in all areas. Sit back and relax… this should be a smooth ride."

"Golf?" McKay asked.

John adjusted the hologram and zoomed in on one small section of the city. Four men and two women were picking up clubs and buckets of balls off the platform and retreating indoors.

"Oh… I thought we stopped doing that when we ran out of water."

"Nope," John said as he warmed up the city's stardrive, "now we send a replicator out to fetch the balls back."

"How ingenuous," McKay dryly commented.

"I thought so," John said mirthfully as the hologram reset to a citywide view overtop the sprawling infrastructure on the planet's surface. The single Terra built beneath the city had grow out into several hundred structures that housed the planet's mining infrastructure, all of which held back the blowing sand with thin protective shields. The structures themselves were hardy enough not to be damaged by the environment, but there was a very real possibility that over time they could be completely buried by the slowly moving dunes that the planet had been named after. The shields kept this from happening as well as covering the small spaceport that had been constructed just north of the Terra.

McKay crossed his arms over his chest. "Tell me that wasn't your idea?"

"Guilty as charged," John admitted. "You wouldn't believe how long I can drive nowadays."

"Ancient muscles and all," McKay guessed jealously.

"Alterran muscles," John corrected him. "By the way, how close are you to breaking 20 minutes?"

"24:57 if you must know," Rodney said grumpily.

"Eight minute pace?"

"I apologize," McKay mocked, "if my overwhelming intellect took the lion's share of the talent away from my body."

"That's just an excuse."

"Says the superhuman."

"If there's one thing I've learned from all the neural downloads, it's that you can customize your body an awful lot if you know how to train properly."

"I'm sorry," Rodney said with just a hint of desperation in his voice, "but I don't think I can handle more than 5 miles a day."

John lifted his head up off the chair in surprise. "You're running five a day?"

"Yeah," Rodney said sheepishly, "for what little good it does."

"Have you even read the training manuals?" John criticized him.

"Skimmed them, why?"

"You're training for 3.1 miles, not five."

"So?"

"You're not getting more speed because you're going too far."

"Meaning what?" Rodney said, perking up a bit, but also very confused.

"Use Hi/Lo training," John suggested.

"Never heard of it."

"High speed, Low drag," the Alterran explained. "Set the pace computer to… 7min pace. Then see how far you can last at that speed."

"7min pace is 21:42 for 5k," McKay quickly calculated.

"Training and racing, Rodney."

"So what, I just keep at it until I can make 5k?"

"No, you get a mile in each day, or half a mile, or whatever it is you can handle right now and let your body adjust to the higher rate of turnover… then you start increasing the distance up to 2 or 2.5 miles. Once you get there," Sheppard continued, "you don't go farther, you go faster, and faster, and faster."

"Until I get up to 20min 5k speed," Rodney said, starting to catch on. "Then I, what? Take a leap of faith and hope I can stretch it out the rest of the way?"

"The adrenaline of a time trial will enhance your workout speed… not to mention taking a couple of days easy before you try. Easy by going shorter, not slower."

"Why hasn't anybody mentioned this before?"

John shrugged. "It's all in the database."

"Truth be told, whenever I'm in the unsecured section of the database," he said with mild rebuke over not having access to the more sensitive information, "I usually browse through the scientific stuff."

"You really ought to read more," Sheppard suggested.

"Yeah, well that's funny coming from someone who's downloaded most of his knowledge."

"Ok then, download more."

"You won't let me!" McKay protested.

"Sure we will," John mocked. "Right after you earn it."

McKay slumped back against the wall. "What is it with Ancients and rites of passage anyway?"

"It's just part of our mojo," John said, concentrating. "Star drive's ready. Here we go."

Up in the control tower Elizabeth felt a slight rumbling coming from deep inside the ship a moment before the horizon seemed to drop out of existence. On impulse, and in defiance of Sheppard's warning, she walked over to the nearest balcony and went outside.

She hung her torso over the railing and watched the surface of Dune and the settlement shrink away beneath them. It didn't matter how many times Atlantis moved through space from planet to planet… she was awestruck every time she witnessed the transition.

She was in a flying city… A FLYING CITY! Even though she now worked alongside the people who had built Atlantis in the first place she still marveled at the Ancient's ingenuity and power. She realized just how much of the Lantean's strength had come not from their own making, but from the Alterra and how the line between first generation Ancient and second generation Ancient had been blurred beyond recognition.

Well, now that she was an Ancient too, junior grade anyway, that difference stood out in stark contrast to her previous perspective and opinions. She was truly blessed to be in the position she was in now, and despite all the heartaches and tribulations that she'd endured since being called to the White House only a handful of years ago to be told about the stargate program, she wouldn't have done anything differently had she the chance again. She was living a dream… and had never been more content.

Suddenly her mind flashed back to her many failures and the ones that had been lost.

"Ok," she whispered as the city left the atmosphere and the stars began to shine in the blackness around them, "maybe some things I'd do differently."

Elizabeth waited on the balcony until Atlantis made the jump into hyperspace and the planet disappeared into a wash of blue/white, then she returned inside, back to the command platform and her duties as city leader.

It was good to be an Ancient.

---

O'Neill woke to someone shaking his shoulder.

For a moment he was groggy, but when his mind transitioned from the dream realm back into the current situation he sat up bolt straight and recognized Landry's face.

"How long have I been out?"

"Eight hours."

Jack frowned. "I said wake me in TWO HOURS!"

Landry shrugged. "Technically you're no longer my commanding officer. I can do what I want."

O'Neill narrowed his eyes as his mind fully defogged. "What's happened."

"Nothing until three minutes ago. You better get dressed and see this for yourself."


Four minutes later a fully uniformed General O'Neill ran up the steps into the control room where Landry and Colonel Larson were waiting for him.

"They're cutting through the main door," Larson said, pointing at a small video screen.

"I thought we lost all surface telemetry?" O'Neill asked.

"We did," Landry confirmed. "It came back on when they started cutting."

"Accidently?" Jack said, not believing it.

"Probably hoping we'll get the message and surrender," Larson commented.

"Fat chance," Jack said under his breath. "How about the phones?"

"Still out," Landry confirmed.

Jack tilted his chin toward the screen. "How long?"

"Siler?" Landry barked.

"Based on conservative estimates," the technician said, appearing from the background, "at least twelve hours."

Jack nodded. "Then we give Hammond another twelve hours."

"Hammond?" Landry asked.

"I talked to him before I came here. He promised he'd do his best to get the word out… and right now he's our only mouthpiece."

"Good thinking," Landry said in approval.

"And in twelve hours?" Larson asked.

"We'll jump off that bridge when we come to it," Jack answered.

"Yes, sir."

"In the mean time, see what kind of barricades we can put up over the main door. Maybe buy us a few more hours."

"Siler," Landry ordered.

"Yes, sir. Already on it," he said, disappearing from view.

"Feeling better," Landry half whispered.

Jack thought for a moment. "Hungry, actually."

"Walter," Landry said over his shoulder. "If anything happens we'll be in the commissary."

"Yes, sir."

"I'm hungry too," Hank said. "Plus, all we can do right now is wait."

"Be glad for the company," Jack admitted.


"You know," Jack said over a piece of pie, "sometimes I wonder if things wouldn't be different if we just told the planet about the stargate."

Landry looked up from his own dessert, a piece of chocolate cake. "You can't be serious?"

Jack gulped another piece. "Why not?"

"Riots, for one."

"Over what?" Jack argued. "In my vast experience people usually riot when they're being screwed over in some way."

"You don't think being lied to counts as being screwed?" Landry asked.

"Not to that level, no."

Landry shook his head. "I think you're being a bit optimistic of human nature… besides, politicians would still run the show either way. Not sure what we'd gain from the revelation."

"I know… " Jack admitted in defeat. "It just feels disingenuous somehow."

"Big word… "

"Yeah, well, my desk has one of these word-a-day calendars… " Jack said, shrugging.

"You can save the world from destruction," Landry said, taking a guess, "but you can't be honest with them."

Jack's head came up slightly. "Exactly."

"It's crossed my mind too," Landry said, slicing off another piece of chocolate fluff.

"And?"

"I try not to dwell on it," he said, putting the piece into his mouth. "Na-ture of the business we're in."

"Rookie," Jack said, eating another piece of pie.

"Rookie?" Landry said, taking slight offense. "How much longer do I have to be in command of the SGC before I lose that moniker?"

"How many times have you saved the planet?"

Landry laughed. "You have a point."

A crackle of static broke through the din followed by Walter's voice. "General Landry to the gateroom. Repeat, General Landry to the gateroom."

Both Generals dropped their forks and left the remains of their desserts on the table.

---

"What have we got, Walter?" Landry asked, two steps ahead of O'Neill.

"Sir, SG-3 just returned from offworld."

"I've got it," Jack said, turning around. He met Colonel Reynolds and company at the door exiting the gateroom.

"General," Reynolds greeted him as O'Neill stopped their forward progress with an upraised hand.

"Long story short… President tried to steal the gate… we're in lockdown buying time for the politicians and brass to chew his head off."

"Did you say 'steal' the gate, sir?" Reynolds said carefully.

"I did… they've already tried to breach security in two locations and are in the process of cutting through the main door right now."

"I don't believe it."

"Believe it or not, it's happening. Get cleaned up and rearmed with intars. We need you on the line."

"Yes, sir," Reynolds said, snapping into action mode. "Let's go," he said over his shoulder to the other members of his unit.

"General," Landry's voice echoed through the gateroom. "We've had communications reinstated."

"Odd," Jack whispered to himself as he reversed direction and climbed back into the control room.

"The phone lines just opened up… all of them. This came through first," Landry told him warily as he handed him a printout. On it was a message from the President.

_Your attempted coup has failed, General O'Neill. The Congress has chosen not to oppose my decision to move the stargate and the military leaders you tried to woo to your side have capitulated as well. Surrender the SGC immediately and I'll let you retire without penalty. Continue this siege and you will be going to jail for the rest of your life._

_President of the United States Frank Cornwallis_

Jack chewed on his cheek for a moment then crunched the paper up into a wad, threw it on the floor, and stomped on it several times in comical frustration. Eventually he stopped and looked around at the gazes he was getting from the control room staff.

"Feel better?" Landry asked, sensing O'Neill's thespianism.

"A little," Jack admitted. "Get on the horn and check this out."

"You think they're bluffing?"

Jack pointed to the viewscreen of the troops on the surface. "If it was a done deal would they still be cutting through the door?"

"Good point," Landry said, not having considered that. "I'll see what I can find out."

"Well?" Jack asked Landry as he stepped out of his office.

"Not exactly what the President said, but still bad news. The Congress ordered him to stand down and he refused, but short of removing him from office there's nothing they can really do… and they've made it clear that option's off the table. They'd have to inform the public about the details if he was kicked out of the White House, and that's something they unanimously said couldn't happen."

Jack suddenly felt sick to his stomach. "They're balking?"

"No… the President is holding his ground, burning any and all bridges in the process. His influence and power are gone, but so long as he is in office he can't be overruled. He's falling on his sword for this… somebody out there must want the stargate in a bad way."

"What about the rest of the military?"

"Ready to roast him alive, but they won't act without Congress's blessing. Personally, I don't see any way out of this, Jack. You might want to consider the retirement offer while it's on the table."

"No… " O'Neill said firmly. "If Congress won't act because they'd have to tell the public what's going on, then we'll save them the trouble and do it ourselves," he said standing up and walking down to the control room in a hurry.

"Jack… you can't," Landry argued from behind him.

"Watch me."

---

Teal'c woke with a headache and blurred vision, lying prone on the floor. His staff weapon was pinched under his chest, resulting no doubt in the ache coming from his shoulder. He must have been lying unconscious on it for many hours.

The Jaffa focused and blinked away the grogginess enough to sit up. There was a wall inches away and he pulled himself over to it and leaned his back against the smooth stone. A moment later he frowned as he realized where he was.

He was sitting in the hallway where he had fallen, and everything around him seemed a bit off…

The cloak, he thought, checking the device on his wrist.

It was still active.

The realization that the enemy had made a vital mistake flushed the remaining sedation from his mind and he stood up, staff weapon in hand. He walked back down the hallway he'd come from and checked the previous intersection. One lone person was walking down the long corridor and ducked inside an adjacent door, but no one else was in sight. SG-1 was gone, probably captured, but they'd missed Teal'c… and they were going to pay for that oversight.

Slipping into his well honed tracking mode, Teal'c began to search the facility, looking for both his friends… and the enemy.

---

"He ordered what?" Dan asked, aghast.

"Full disclosure," Mark told his fellow scientist. "They're putting together an information packet now. We need to find as many ways of disseminating the information as we can."

"This is nuts," Dan whispered.

"I think 'nuts' is the General's middle name," Mark said as he started to work on his laptop. "We can't just use civilian links, we need to send it to every government agency around the planet. Start compiling a list of likely candidates in Asia, will ya?"

"Sure," Dan said as Mark's mind went off into academic mode, dismissing all else around him. He was going to follow O'Neill's orders and blow the top off the whole shebang just to get back at the President. Dan didn't know what kind of riots and civil unrest would result from the revelation, but he figured it wouldn't be pretty no matter how it went down.

One thing was for sure… the days of the SGC were over if the secret ever got out, as was his job. Bring the civilians into the equation and he'd be squeezed out overnight by people deemed 'more qualified' just because of their pompous citations. The covert aspect of this assignment was the only reason Dan, a former CIA software analyst, had been pegged for consideration. Bring in the masses and he'd be relegated to fixing office laptops...

No, this had to stop now before it went too far. The President was the ranking officer, not General O'Neill. Granted, he didn't think moving the stargate was a good idea either, but the General had gotten way out of line and it was the responsibility of those serving in the SGC to obey the orders of the commander and chief… let alone defend national security.

It was going to be a few hours before they could assemble a full list of routing codes so Dan had time, he hoped, to stop this catastrophe from happening.

He glanced over at Mark and saw he was fully enveloped in his work. Dan pulled his own laptop screen slightly askew from Mark's view next to him just enough for the security filter to make the image unreadable. He waited a few minutes, going about his assigned tasks without incident, before writing a brief text message and sending it off to the terminals above the base where the President's men were now stationed.

Dan glanced at his fellow scientist again, but Mark hadn't noticed. Dan closed the communications prompt and went back to work with the knowledge that he'd done his duty...and most likely saved his job.

---

"General O'Neill!" Walter called out suddenly. "All communications have been severed again."

"What?!" Jack yelled from a few dozen feet down the hall where he was talking with SG-19.

"I'm sorry, sir. Everything just went down," the technical Sergeant confirmed with a softer voice when Jack came into the control room.

"We've got nothing then?"

"No, sir," Walter said apologetically.

"That doesn't make any sense," Landry interjected. "Why would they cut it off now? They've already won."

"Have you been making more phone calls?" Jack asked.

Landry shrugged innocently. "Haven't needed to. That's why I don't understand this, unless it's just out of spite."

"Or someone snitched," O'Neill growled.

Landry's eyes narrowed dangerous. "If they did we'll find out. There's nowhere they can run."

"Yeah," Jack said, his eyes drifting to the stargate. "Any word from our offworld teams?"

"Not since SG-2 radioed in an hour ago, no," Landry told him.

O'Neill was silent for a long minute, looking out the window at the gate. No one dared interrupt him. Everyone knew that the hammer was going to come down on him the hardest. These were probably his last few private moments before being hauled off to a jail cell for the rest of his life.

"Keep working on the info packet," he finally ordered. "We need to be ready if the lines open up again. And have Siler keep trying to find another way of getting the word out."

"Will do," Landry confirmed. "In the mean time I'll do a little checking to see if we have a rat on base."

"I'll be around," Jack said half sarcastically as he left the control room and headed farther into the base. He wasn't headed anywhere in particular, but he felt like he needed to get away so he began a quiet little tour of the facility.

He checked on the SG teams guarding the auxiliary exits… the guards put on the beaming jammers… the prisoners in the holding cells… the scientists working on his plan, which he'd belatedly nicknamed Project: Facepalm.

After that he walked through the less populated areas… through the storage rooms, power generation, empty personnel wings… he didn't know what was going to happen, but he had an eerie sense that he wouldn't be seeing the SGC again and felt compelled to say a personal goodbye while he still had the time.

Jack spent the next four hours wondering about but eventually ended up back in Landry's office.

"Any change?" he asked.

Hank shook his head. "None… but we did find the rat. One of the scientists working on the project. He sent a text message to the surface...we assume the President's men relayed it from there. We've got the man, a Dr. Dan Irving, in a holding cell if you want to take a poke at him," Landry said, meaning every word.

"Wouldn't do any good now," O'Neill said, his last hope gone. If the President had been informed there was no way they were getting communications back. "How much time is left on the clock?"

"A little over five hours… "

O'Neill nodded. "I need to borrow your computer."

Landry was silent for a moment. "Falling on your sword?"

"None of you asked for this," Jack said quickly. "I'll try and clean it up best I can. Pick out one of the prisoners to deliver a message to the surface."

"We'll have to cut the doors back open," Landry noted, his tone sullen.

"Better get started. We need to beat their cutting teams to avoid a firefight."

"Alright, Jack," Landry said, standing up and spinning his seat around. "The chair's all yours."

"Thanks," O'Neill whispered as he sat down. Landry looked at him sadly then turned to leave.

"Hank."

"Yeah?" Landry answered, turning back around.

"Deprive the rat of his clothes."

Hank half smiled. "Will do."

---

After O'Neill finished typing up his letter, addressed to the people of the United States and not the treasonous, backstabbing President, he printed it out and signed it. As he set the pen down beside the paper he felt a pang of separation. It was the last signature he'd ever write on this desk. Part of him was ok with that… he'd always hated paperwork… but it also stung with the bitter taste of defeat.

He'd done his part… stopped the quick, devious transport of the stargate and gave the American government the time to act… but as politicians always do, they'd screwed it up. Jack knew he wasn't at fault, but that didn't make him feel any better. After all that had transpired over the past two decades it was politicians that were going to do them in.

Somehow that seemed appropriate. Jack and the other few good men and women in the stargate program couldn't carry the planet forever. They'd bought them time to grow and learn to defend themselves, but Earth seemed hell-bent on its self destruction… at least Jack wasn't going to be around to see it happen.

As he stared down at the single piece of paper O'Neill's mind flashed back to the first time the politicians tried to shut down the stargate program… and how they'd had to defy orders and go through the gate in order to try and defend Earth against a Goa'uld attack.

Jack was tired of working with backstabbing, greedy, unscrupulous morons. At least that part of his life was coming to an end… he just hadn't wished it'd be this way.

None the less, he was finally cutting that cord. A small part of his inner self relished the moment for what it was as he left Landry's office and headed back to his quarters, but the overwhelming sense of sadness persisted.

He opened the door to his quarters and gratuitously slammed the door behind him. The bang felt good and jolted him from his stupor. He was in danger… and he had to get out of here while he still had the chance. If the forces outside got their hands on him… or his own men decided to act in their stead… he was a goner. He'd done the prison thing before and silently steeled himself to never letting that happen again.

Jack pulled open his closet and looked at the half dozen uniforms hanging up there. All were variations of his dress uniform… save one.

He started to peel off the dress uniform he wore now and let the pieces of the bureaucratic monkey suit fall to the ground where they belonged. Wearing nothing but his underwear Jack pulled out the field uniform that he'd kept around for the off chance of needing to go offworld as much as for old times sake and began to pull on the dark green fatigues.

As he laced up his combat boots the sadness of the situation faded away as old memories flashed back to the surface. He was a warrior, not a paper pusher. He never should have accepted the promotion to General. He belonged in the field, not an office. He'd figured he could do more good for the stargate program and Earth as a General in the shiny upper brass…

He silently kicked himself for his naivety. He should have known better. The politicians were always in charge. The only thing he'd accomplished was to stall the downfall of the planet. He couldn't stop it.

Well, if it was an alien invasion, sure… but when it was Earth's own doing the damage there wasn't anything he could do about that. Earth was going to survive or fall based on the actions of its people, and if they wanted to self destruct that was their business now. Jack was glad to finally wash his hands of the mess. He liked the planet well enough, but he liked sanity more… and now it was time to go.

O'Neill finished lacing up his second boot and stood up in front of the mirror.

"Where have you been?" he asked his image as if he were Peter Pan talking to his shadow.

Jack patted down the uniform on his chest, visually acknowledging his lack of gear. He didn't have any stashed away here… he'd have to stop by the armory.

"Here goes," he said to himself as he stepped out of his former quarters and walked casually down the hallway. He felt both scared and excited at the same time. He didn't know where he was going or what he was going to do, and that prospect was unnerving, but it was also exhilarating. He felt **_alive_** for the first time in years…

Maybe Daniel had the right idea after all.

Vala laid crumpled up in a ball in the corner of a cell when she finally awoke. Her groggy eyes struggled to focus in the dim light, but the Human style prison bars were clearly visible in front of her. She shook her head clear and glanced around… she was alone in the cell.

"Wonderful," she muttered to herself as she got to her feet, though a bit wobbly.

"Now… what do we have to work with," she said, inspecting the bars. The hinges were well oiled, the latch solid, and the locking mechanism on the outside of the cell. Her fingers reached around and felt for the keyhole.

"Damn," she whispered, feeling a card swipe slot. Vala turned around and looked at the rest of the cell… four bare walls,
a floor, and a ceiling.
"Well… this is going to be a challenge," she declared. "Guard!"

"Guard?" she asked in a more subdued voice when no one responded. She pushed her face up against the bars and tried to look down the hallway. "Anybody?"

Vala pulled back and sighed. "Well it doesn't seem like I'm going to be using my wits to get out of this… or my charm… guess that leaves waiting to be rescued," she said
experimentally.
"Right," she whispered. "What other options do I have?"

Vala looked around at the empty cell. She didn't have anything other than the clothes on her back.

She rubbed the loose collar of her uniform shirt and raised an eyebrow. "Hmm..."

---

Half an hour later Vala heard someone approaching and smiled to herself, but held perfectly still. When the guards came into view of her cell she heard one of them gasp.

Lying with her face towards the wall opposite the bars, but with the rest of her body face up on the very cold floor, the completely nude Vala had quite an effect on the two male guards that had come for her… but she dare not move. Not yet.

A sick, creepy feeling manifested in her gut but she pushed it aside… she needed to appear as serene and helpless as possible so the guards would come in close where she could kick them in the head and take whatever weapons they might be carrying.

"Well, this is an unexpected treat," a third individual said, whose footfalls sounded a couple of heartbeats later.

Vala didn't recognize the voice, but it had a distinctive accent. She assumed it was Chinese, but to be honest she hadn't studied that boring branch of Earth's culture in much detail. She'd dealt with Honor-centric societies before and found they gave her a headache.

That creepy feeling wouldn't abate, and even as Vala heard the door to her cell open and the moment of opportunity presented itself she couldn't shake the sense that something was terribly wrong.

The guards had come to remove her to another chamber and, in lieu of her actually walking, they were more than pleased to manhandle her naked body and moved in to pick her up.

The was a brief dispute as to who got which end, but one groped her chest as he got a grip on her torso and began to lift her up. Before the other could grab her feet she pulled her left knee up and, flexing backwards, gave her joints enough range to smash her kneecap into the man's forehead.

He staggered backwards in shock, but Vala didn't hesitate. She quickly kicked the other guard in the groin and got to her feet in a fighting stance, looking for weapons… but there were none. She noted the presence of a man in the hallway but he was out of reach so she hit the first man in the throat with stiffened knuckles and dropped him to the ground. She turned around and punched the other man, still struggling with her hit to his groin, in the face one, two, three times.

She finished him off with a heel kick to the face then ran to the open door to attack the remaining guard with a double-legged jump kick to his midsection.

The third man saw it coming and easily knocked her legs aside. Vala fell hard to the floor but tried to leg sweep the man despite knocking her head pretty good. She managed to knock one leg out from under him, but the other held firm and he caught his balance.

With a super-humanly strong grip the man reached down and picked Vala up off the floor by the throat and brought her face up near his. "Nice try," he said amicably.

The creepy feeling inside Vala finally clicked in place and her eyes widened with recognition. The man noticed her reaction and frowned… then his eyes widened with realization. He glanced back in the cell, confirming that both guards were unconscious on the floor, then shook his head at Vala.

"Now what am I going to do with you, Human," he said in an altered voice, finishing the last word off with a very familiar eye flash.

---

"General O'Neill," Walter called out excitedly as Jack neared the gateroom. "Your list, sir," he said after he caught up with him and handed him a thick stapled set of papers.

"Thank you, Chief," O'Neill said, pulling his equipment pack off his shoulders and stuffing the papers inside.

"Sir… ," Walter continued, "it's been an honor," he finished with a salute.

O'Neill lazily returned it. "Thank you," he said, pulling his
overstuffed pack back on.

"The others are waiting for you in the gateroom," Walter added.

O'Neill clapped the technician on the shoulder and moved on.

"Sir?" Walter asked quickly.

"Ya?" Jack said, hesitating.
"Where do you want to go?"

O'Neill walked on then shouted back over his shoulder, "Somewhere with trees."

"With trees?" Walter whispered to himself, trying to process the General's meaning. After a moment he walked back up into the gateroom and starting to sift through all the addresses in the database and pick out a safe one that 'had trees.'

"Attention!" Landry barked when the doors to the gateroom opened.

All the SG teams on base stood in a tightly packed formation in respect for O'Neill with only a thin path to the gate remaining between the green uniformed mass.

Jack nodded to them as he walked through their ranks to the foot of the ramp heading up to the stargate as the inner
track spun as Walter dialed an address.

"I guess this is goodbye," Landry said.

"All good things… " Jack noted.
"Unfortunately," Landry echoed, catching his reference.

Jack turned to address all others present. Even those in the control room were standing at attention, visible through the safety glass.

"I'm sorry things had to go down this way. I hope the powers that be don't take it out on you guys, and I've written a letter to the suits taking full responsibility for this botched operation. From here on out I honestly don't know what's going to happen… for me or for you, but I want you to know that I don't regret my actions, or my decision to oppose the President. It was the right thing to do, and like the clich…  clearly states, now comes the punishment."

"I've never been prouder of any group of men under my command. The work you've done in the SGC over the years makes you all true heroes… and your recent behavior has once again confirmed that fact. It's been an honor serving with you all… good luck."

The stargate activated with a kawoosh over the ramp then
settled down into the typical event horizon.

"Hank, I'd like to ask you a favor."
"Anything," Landry said.

"Tell Hammond this was the only way it could have gone down.
I couldn't have sat on my hands and done nothing."
"Sure thing, Jack."

O'Neill stepped up onto the ramp and took a few steps. He unclipped the P-90 from his vest and held it ready in both hands across his chest. He felt like he should say more, but couldn't find the words. He turned his head back and nodded to everyone once more beneath his green cap then walked the last few steps up the ramp and into the event horizon.

Landry watched him disappear into the blue glow then checked his watch. It'd been ten minutes since they'd dispatched the prisoner with the letter up through the emergency hatch. It should have reached the commander on the surface by now.

"Walter," Landry yelled back up to the control room. "End the lockdown."

---

As soon as the lockdown ended and the beaming jammers retracted to only cover the stargate, a small team beamed down into the SGC in the equipment rooms where the beaming jammers were kept. With the guards now gone, the three man team quickly accessed the equipment and bypassed the control room link. They completely deactivated the jamming devices then activated their transport coins, returning back to orbit before anyone was the wiser.

---

"Yes, sir," the technician's voice came back over the intercom, acknowledging the order as he activated the controls and ended the lockdown.

"Alright everyone," Landry said to the SG teams still standing at attention. "Return to your quarters and stay there until called for. There are probably some angry people up top… let's not give them an opportunity for a confrontation. Once I receive orders I'll… "

Suddenly the stargate disappeared from behind Landry, whisked away, no doubt, via one of the orbiting 304s.

"Son of a bitch," Landry grumbled. "We've still got teams
offworld."

"Sir?" Reynolds asked, ready to do something.
"Fall out," Landry said with a sigh and a shake of his head.

"Yes, sir," Reynolds said dejectedly. "You heard the General. Back to your bunks."

The gateroom slowly emptied, with Landry the last person out. He looked back at where the stargate had been and shook his head. "Dear God, what have we come to?"

---

Three days later Landry sat in Hammond's backyard with a beer and a hotdog in his hands as the former Generals sat and looked at the campfire before them and the stars overhead. Landry and the others had been spared official reprimand, but the President had shut down the SGC and permanently closed Cheyenne Mountain. Landry had opted for retirement rather than reassignment… not that he'd been offered one. Most of the SGC personnel hadn't been pegged for reassignment to the new I.O.A. SGC in Egypt either, and Landry felt it best not to try and ride a dead horse.

"I wonder where he is now," Hank said, leaning back in his lawn chair.

"I don't know," Hammond said, the only other person seated around the campfire. "I don't think he'd ask the Tok'ra for help."

"No, I don't think he would either," Landry echoed. "Maybe he
went to Dakara."
"What's on Dakara?" Hammond asked.

Landry glanced over at his fellow retired General. "That's right, you don't know. Bra'tac's new Jaffa Empire is based on Dakara."

"Bra'tac's always been a close ally," Hammond said evenly. "But I have a feeling Jack's not going to be in the mood for company right now."

"I wouldn't blame him," Landry agreed. "He got the rug pulled out from under him pretty hard."

"That he did," Hammond said, raising his beer bottle up towards the stars. Landry mirrored the informal salute.

Hammond picked a star and looked up in its direction. "God speed, Jack."

Atlantis emerged from hyperspace with a flash and immediately throttled up its realspace engines to counter the drift speed between the Dune system and the water-world beneath them. It amounted to only a few thousand miles per hour and a few long seconds of thrust, but it brought them down towards the planet's atmosphere quicker than usual.

"We're here," John noted to himself from the control chair. He'd slid back into the seat only moments ago and found himself experiencing a sense of d… j…  vu, realizing this must have been the same approach the Alterrans had originally made when they brought Atlantis to the Pegasus galaxy.

The atmosphere began licking at the city's shields as Sheppard searched for the previous landing coordinates not far off the mainland that was just now coming across the horizon. The city's computer highlighted a specific patch of ocean and John set course to put them down in the same spot where they'd first found the city.

The descent was easy enough. John didn't rush it and lazily brought Atlantis down over the ocean, hovering in place over the surface before gently letting it sink into the waves. The city's buoyancy brought it back up after a brief moment below the water line and Sheppard let it settle for a full minute before disengaging the shields and powering down the
chair.

"Home sweet home," he said as he walked out of the chair room.

"We all set?" he asked when he got back to the control room.

"Yes," Elizabeth confirmed alongside Ryan, Kyle, and Matt Stevenson. "We were just waiting for you. Care to give the order?"

"Thank you, I think I will," John said, stepping up behind
the control room technicians, most of whom were Asgard.
"Activate the beacon."

One of the Asgard meekly togged the glowing Ancient controls, seemingly unconcerned with what they were doing.

A small icon began to pulse on one of the consoles, indicating that Altantis's emergency beacon was active. The rest of Atlantis's allies had already been informed of the plan so they wouldn't respond to the beacon and rush to the city's aid. The only ones Atlantis wanted to come were the Wraith… and come they knew they would. En mass.

Sheppard glanced up at the ceiling and whispered. "Come and get it."
